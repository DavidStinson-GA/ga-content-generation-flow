    - Selected to build progressively toward the overall module goal.
    - Use descriptive subsection names that reflect the actual content 
      (e.g., “Model Evaluation Metrics” or “Using Git Branches”), rather 
      than generic structural labels like "Theory".
    - Include estimated time durations for each microlesson. These 
      estimates should reflect realistic pacing for remote or hybrid 
      delivery, keeping Little to no prior coding experience; basic computer literacy is assumed. Students are adult learners and aspiring professionals. in mind, including time for 
      guided practice and learner interaction.
    - Ensure each microlesson balances conceptual understanding and 
      practical application, tied clearly to industry-relevant skills and 
      tasks.
    - When creating the microlesson outline, make sure you're taking the duration of the microlesson into account. 

5.  Embed Best Practices:
    Ensure alignment with GA's adult learning theory as outlined in 
    "general_assembly_learning_philosophy" and curriculum design best 
    practices including:
    - Keep theory concise and actionable.
    - Make activities highly relevant and tool-aligned with Visual Studio Code.

Your process should involve the following steps, informed by the provided  module topic, learner persona, how many minutes the module is,and learning  objectives as follows:
The module topic is: This JavaScript Arrays module is designed to provide a comprehensive introduction to arrays, a fundamental list datatype in programming. The module concludes with an extended practical exercise where learners will create, modify, and iterate through an array of strings. This content is suitable for beginners who are relatively new to JavaScript programming. 
The learner persona is: Little to no prior coding experience; basic computer literacy is assumed. Students are adult learners and aspiring professionals.
The learning objectives are: ['Define JavaScript arrays and explain how they organize data.\n', 'Identify the components of an array, including its elements and index positions.\n', 'Create arrays using JavaScript literal notation.\n', 'Access and modify elements within an array using square brackets.\n', 'Use basic array methods, such as push() and pop(), to manage array data.\n']

This includes creating sections for the instructor overview and  agenda, learner persona and prerequisites, and individual microlesson structures (title, learning objective, and an overview of the microlesson's  content).
Your process should involve the following steps, informed by the provided  module topic, learner persona, how many minutes the module is,and learning  objectives as follows:
The module topic is: This JavaScript Arrays module is designed to provide a comprehensive introduction to arrays, a fundamental list datatype in programming. The module concludes with an extended practical exercise where learners will create, modify, and iterate through an array of strings. This content is suitable for beginners who are relatively new to JavaScript programming. 
The learner persona is: Little to no prior coding experience; basic computer literacy is assumed. Students are adult learners and aspiring professionals.
The learning objectives are: ['Define JavaScript arrays and explain how they organize data.\n', 'Identify the components of an array, including its elements and index positions.\n', 'Create arrays using JavaScript literal notation.\n', 'Access and modify elements within an array using square brackets.\n', 'Use basic array methods, such as push() and pop(), to manage array data.\n']
The module is 90 minutes long.
1.  Define Module Title: Use the provided title: Introduction to Javascript Arrays.
2.  Analyze Inputs and Infer Context:
    Review the provided module topic, learner persona, and any 
    learning objectives. From these, infer:
    - Appropriate technical or domain prerequisites.
    - Learner motivations, goals, and challenges.
    - Real-world contexts and examples relevant to the topic.

3.  Design Microlesson Structure:
    Determine the number and sequence of microlessons based on number of 
    learning objectives provided. For each microlesson:
    - Create a concise title.
    - Outline key theoretical concepts to be introduced.
    - Include a method for learners to check their understanding (e.g., a 
      multiple-choice question, coding prompt, or reflection).
    - Include estimated time durations for each microlesson. These
      should reflect realistic pacing for remote or hybrid delivery, 
      keeping Little to no prior coding experience; basic computer literacy is assumed. Students are adult learners and aspiring professionals. in mind, including time for guided practice 
      and learner interaction.

4.  Populate the Outline with Clear, Industry-Relevant Content:
    For each microlesson, provide a detailed overview of the key topics to 
    be covered. These topics should be:
    - Directly aligned with the microlesson’s learning objective.

    - Selected to build progressively toward the overall module goal.
    - Use descriptive subsection names that reflect the actual content

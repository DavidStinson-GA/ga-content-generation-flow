# Creating Arrays with Literal Notation

**Learning Objective:** Create arrays using JavaScript literal notation.

## Introduction to array literal notation syntax

Arrays are foundational in programming because they allow you to store and work with lists of values—such as numbers, words, or other useful data—all grouped under a single variable name.

In JavaScript, the simplest way to create an array is by using *literal notation*, which means directly typing your list inside square brackets: `[ ]`. 

Imagine you have a shelf where you line up objects in a specific order. Similarly, in an array, you organize your data items in a particular sequence.

The structure is straightforward:

```javascript
let colors = ['red', 'green', 'blue'];
// colors holds three elements: 'red', 'green', and 'blue'
```

- The *opening bracket* `[` starts the array.
- Each *element* (the items inside) is separated by a comma.
- The *closing bracket* `]` indicates the end of the array.

> 📚 An *element* is an individual item stored at a specific position within an array.

## Creating arrays with different data types

JavaScript arrays are highly flexible. Unlike some programming languages where all elements must be the same type, JavaScript arrays can hold a mix—a number, a word, a true/false value, or even another array.

Think of an array as a box that can hold different objects: a ball, a book, and a keychain can all fit together.

Here is a clear example:

```javascript
let mixedArray = [28, 'apple', true, null];
// mixedArray holds: 28, 'apple', true, and null
```

- `28` is a number.
- `'apple'` is a string (text).
- `true` is a boolean (true or false).
- `null` means "no value" or "empty."

Arrays can also hold other arrays. This is called a "nested array"—much like placing a box within a box.

```javascript
let nestedArray = [[1, 2], ['a', 'b']];
// nestedArray holds an array of numbers and an array of letters
```

> 💡 JavaScript arrays are adaptable containers. They are often used to manage diverse information collected together, just like a folder or digital playlist can hold files of different kinds.

## Empty arrays and their uses

You will not always know in advance what should go into your array. Sometimes, you start with an empty list and fill it as you go.

To create an empty array with literal notation:

```javascript
let emptyList = [];
// emptyList currently holds zero elements
```

Think of this as setting out an empty tray before adding snacks to it.

Why might you use an empty array?

- To collect data as it arrives, such as survey responses or scores earned as a game is played.
- To store results from calculations as you process them one step at a time.
- To help organize your code if you need to build a list gradually.

You can add new items to your array later using JavaScript's `.push()` method:

```javascript
emptyList.push('first item');
// emptyList now holds: ['first item']
```

## Demonstration: Creating various arrays in Visual Studio Code

Let’s practice using Visual Studio Code (VS Code) or any JavaScript-friendly editor.

Here are some hands-on examples. Read each, then try typing them out yourself and changing the data to match your own experiences and interests.

**Example 1: An array of favorite foods**

```javascript
let favoriteFoods = ['rice', 'pasta', 'mango'];
console.log(favoriteFoods);
// Prints: ['rice', 'pasta', 'mango']
```

**Example 2: An array with numbers**

```javascript
let luckyNumbers = [7, 42, 3];
console.log(luckyNumbers);
// Prints: [7, 42, 3]
```

**Example 3: An array with mixed types**

```javascript
let travelItems = ['passport', 2, false];
console.log(travelItems);
// Prints: ['passport', 2, false]
```

**Example 4: An empty array to fill with user input**

```javascript
let completedTasks = [];
console.log(completedTasks);
// Prints: []
```

> 🏆 Use `console.log()` to check the array contents as you code. This helps you see how arrays store and organize the data you care about.

Take a moment to modify one of the above examples, replacing the values with something personal, such as your favorite hobbies, languages you speak, or places you wish to travel.

## Guided practice: Creating arrays based on real-world scenarios

Now, let’s make arrays that reflect everyday life and common projects.

Below are a few scenarios to consider:

- Keeping track of books you would like to read.
- Creating a list of participants in a group video call.
- Storing weekly rainfall measurements from a weather experiment.
- Outlining ingredients needed for a recipe.
- Organizing your top five favorite destinations.

Try writing out literal notation arrays for two of these examples, choosing scenarios that resonate with you.

For example, to make a list of recipe ingredients:

```javascript
let ingredients = ['rice flour', 'water', 'salt', 'spices'];
```

Or if you are saving cities you wish to visit:

```javascript
let dreamCities = ['Istanbul', 'Nairobi', 'Seoul', 'Santiago'];
```

> 💡 Arrays can be used for almost any situation where you would keep a list—whether it is for tracking tasks, collecting survey results, or storing digital playlists.

## Activity: Solo array creation challenge

It is time to apply what you have learned in a way that connects directly to your life or interests.

**Purpose:**  
This activity reinforces your ability to use JavaScript literal notation to create arrays, encouraging personal relevance and practical coding skills.

**Step-by-step instructions:**

1. Open Visual Studio Code or your favorite JavaScript workspace.

2. Think of three lists from your life or interests. Each list should have at least three items.
    - For example: favorite artists, shopping items, languages you want to learn, significant global cities, or types of cuisine you enjoy.

3. For each list:
    - Use JavaScript literal notation (`[ ]`) to create an array and place your items as elements inside.
    - Assign each array to a variable with a clear, descriptive name, using `let` or `const`.
    - Include at least one array with elements of different data types (for instance, a mix of text, numbers, or true/false values).

4. Use `console.log()` to display each array in your console.

5. Double-check your syntax:
    - Use square brackets `[ ]`.
    - Separate elements with commas.
    - Wrap strings (text) in single quotes.

**Sample output:**

```javascript
let favoriteLanguages = ['JavaScript', 'Mandarin', 'Swahili'];
console.log(favoriteLanguages);
// Prints: ['JavaScript', 'Mandarin', 'Swahili']

let packingList = ['toothbrush', 2, false];
console.log(packingList);
// Prints: ['toothbrush', 2, false]
```

**Deliverable:**  
Share your three array code snippets in the class chat, or, if working on your own, save them in your project folder for easy reference.

### Discussion prompt

Why might it be helpful to start with an empty array, instead of filling it immediately? Can you think of a real-world example where you need to let your array grow as new data arrives or as users add input?

Share your thoughts on when arrays, especially empty ones, could help you keep things organized or solve a common problem.

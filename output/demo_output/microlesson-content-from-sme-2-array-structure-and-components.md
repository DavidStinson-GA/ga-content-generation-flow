# Array Structure and Components

**Learning Objective:** Identify the components of an array, including its elements and index positions.

## Understanding array elements

Arrays are a way to store more than one value in a single variable. You can think of an array as a "list" of values, kept together and organized in a specific order. Each entry in this list is called an *element* of the array.

For example, let's imagine you wanted to keep track of your three favorite colors. You might use three different variables like this:

```javascript
let color1 = "blue";
let color2 = "green";
let color3 = "yellow";
```

But what if you wanted to manage more colors, or sort and search them? It quickly gets complicated using separate variables. Arrays help by letting you put all the colors into a single structure, like this:

```javascript
let favoriteColors = ["blue", "green", "yellow"];
```

Now, `"blue"`, `"green"`, and `"yellow"` are all elements of the `favoriteColors` array.

### Real-world analogy

If you've ever made a shopping list, you've used something like an array. Each item—"milk," "bread," "eggs"—is an element on the list. The list itself is the array.

## Exploring index positions: Zero-based numbering

Every element in an array has a position, called its *index*. In JavaScript (and most programming languages), arrays use **zero-based numbering**. This means the first element is at position 0, the second is at position 1, and so on.

Let's look at our earlier example:

```javascript
let favoriteColors = ["blue", "green", "yellow"];
```

Here's how the index positions work:

- `"blue"` is at index 0
- `"green"` is at index 1
- `"yellow"` is at index 2

This system of starting from 0 might feel strange at first, but it's the standard in JavaScript. This is important to remember when you're accessing or changing elements in an array.

### Accessing elements by index

To get a particular element, you use the array name followed by the index in square brackets. For example:

```javascript
console.log(favoriteColors[1]); // Outputs: green
```

Here, `favoriteColors[1]` means "give me the element at index 1 of `favoriteColors`," which is `"green"`.

## Demonstration: Examining array structure in Visual Studio Code

Let's open Visual Studio Code and create an array together.

1. Open a new file and save it as `arrays-demo.js`.
2. Type out the following array:

    ```javascript
    let fruits = ["apple", "banana", "cherry", "date"];
    ```

3. Try printing the entire array to the console:

    ```javascript
    console.log(fruits);
    ```

   This will output:

    ```
    [ 'apple', 'banana', 'cherry', 'date' ]
    ```

4. Let's print a specific element, say the third one:

    ```javascript
    console.log(fruits[2]);
    ```

   The output will be:

    ```
    cherry
    ```

5. What if you try to access an index that doesn't exist? Try this:

    ```javascript
    console.log(fruits[5]);
    ```

   Since there isn't a sixth element (remember, we count from 0), this will print:

    ```
    undefined
    ```

   This shows that arrays only have elements at numbered index positions that exist; anything else gives you `undefined`.

## Activity: Mapping out the structure of a given array

Let's get hands-on and make sure you can identify the elements and indexes in any array.

### Instructions

1. Below is an array assigned to a variable called `pets`:

    ```javascript
    let pets = ["dog", "cat", "parrot", "goldfish"];
    ```

2. Write out, in your own words or using a table, the following information for the array above:
    - What are the elements of the `pets` array?
    - What is the index of each element?

    For support, here’s an example of how you might organize this:

    | Index | Element    |
    |-------|------------|
    |   0   | "dog"      |
    |   1   | "cat"      |
    |   2   | "parrot"   |
    |   3   | "goldfish" |

3. Now, pick your own topic—like favorite movies, pizza toppings, cities you want to visit, or anything else that interests you!
    - Create an array with at least four elements.
    - For each element, note its index number.
    - Print each element and its index to the console using this template:

        ```javascript
        let myArray = [/* your items here */];
        console.log("Index 0:", myArray[0]);
        // Repeat for each index
        ```

4. Share your custom array structure (the array and an index-element table) in the class chat or on the class collaboration board. Be prepared to talk about:
    - Why you chose your array topic
    - How understanding indexes can help you when working with arrays

### Deliverable

- Post your array code and your index-element table to the chat or class board.
- Respond to at least one other learner’s post, commenting on their array or asking a question about their indexing.

### Discussion prompt

How does knowing about array elements and their index positions make it easier to manage data in a program? Think about a time in everyday life when you needed to keep track of ordered items—how does having an index (like a position in a list) help you? Share your thoughts in the group discussion.

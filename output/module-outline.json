  "overview": "This JavaScript Arrays module provides a comprehensive introduction to arrays, a fundamental list datatype in programming. Designed for beginners new to JavaScript, the module covers array creation, accessing and modifying elements, and basic array methods. It concludes with a practical exercise where learners will create, modify, and iterate through an array of strings, reinforcing key concepts through hands-on application.",

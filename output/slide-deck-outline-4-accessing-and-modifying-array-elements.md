**Slide 1**
# Accessing and modifying array elements
Section-title

Get hands-on with JavaScript arrays: learn how to look up, change, and add items using square bracket notation.

  
PURPOSE:
Introduce the microlesson and learning objective; set context for beginners.

TALKING POINTS

- Arrays as organized lists in JavaScript
- Today’s focus: accessing and modifying with []
- No prior coding experience required

TEACHING TIPS

- Reassure learners about pace: all beginners here
- Use friendly analogies (lockers, bookshelves)

---

**Slide 2**
## Square bracket notation: the basics
Slide content

- Arrays use numbered positions called "indexes"
- Access element: array name + [index number]
- JavaScript counting starts at 0 (zero-based)
- Example:

```javascript
let fruits = ['apple', 'banana', 'cherry'];
console.log(fruits[0]); // Output: apple
console.log(fruits[2]); // Output: cherry
```

- Analogy: Like numbered lockers or bookshelf spots

  
PURPOSE:
Introduce how to access array elements and reinforce the concept of zero-based indexing.

TALKING POINTS

- Demonstrate reading and understanding array positions
- Emphasize that first item is index 0
- Use analogy to build intuition

TEACHING TIPS

- Visualize array as a physical set of slots
- Pause to let learners predict outputs

---

**Slide 3**
## Modifying elements using indexes
Slide content

- Square brackets also update existing items
- Assign new value: array[index] = new value
- Example:

```javascript
let colors = ['red', 'green', 'blue'];
colors[1] = 'yellow';
console.log(colors); // ['red', 'yellow', 'blue']
```

- Analogy: Replacing contents in a specific locker


PURPOSE:
Show how learners can change array elements in-place.

TALKING POINTS

- Access with index; assign with =
- Original element is replaced
- Use real-life lists as examples

TEACHING TIPS

- Compare to updating a to-do list item
- Walk through before/after for clarity

---

**Slide 4**
## Adding new elements at specific positions
Slide content

- Arrays can grow: assign to a new index
- Assigning at array.length adds to end
- Example 1: Add by index

```javascript
let animals = ['cat', 'dog'];
animals[2] = 'hamster';
console.log(animals);
// ['cat', 'dog', 'hamster']
```

- Example 2: Use length to add last

```javascript
let books = ['1984', 'Brave New World'];
books[books.length] = 'Fahrenheit 451';
console.log(books);
// ['1984', 'Brave New World', 'Fahrenheit 451']
```

- Note: Skipping indexes leaves blanks (undefined)


PURPOSE:
Help learners understand dynamic array sizing and how to add items.

TALKING POINTS

- Assign to next index to add new item
- Use length for simple, safe additions
- Skipping indexes creates gaps

TEACHING TIPS

- Recommend only adding at end for now
- Mention alternative like .push(), but focus on brackets

**Slide 5**
## Visualizing access and modification
Slide content

Side-by-side table:

| Code                  | Output                         | What happens                   |
|-----------------------|-------------------------------|--------------------------------|
| fruits[0]             | 'apple'                       | Access first element           |
| colors[1] = 'yellow'; | ['red', 'yellow', 'blue']     | Modify at index 1              |
| books[books.length]=… | ['1984', 'Brave…', 'Fahrenheit 451'] | Add new element at end         |


PURPOSE:
Give a quick, visual summary of access/modification examples.

TALKING POINTS

- How code translates to array changes
- Access vs. modification vs. addition
- Encourage learners to read code left-to-right

TEACHING TIPS

- Invite learners to explain each row
- Reinforce table with code editor/visual demo

---

**Slide 6**
## Common mistakes and how to avoid them
Slide content

- Accessing non-existent index → returns undefined
- Skipping indexes creates gaps filled with undefined
- Indexes must be numbers, not strings
- Negative indexes don’t work in JS arrays

Quick error examples:

```javascript
let pets = ['parrot', 'iguana'];
console.log(pets[5]);    // undefined

let groceries = ['bread'];
groceries[3] = 'milk';
console.log(groceries);  // ['bread', undefined, undefined, 'milk']
```

PURPOSE:
Warn about frequent beginner pitfalls in array access and updates.

TALKING POINTS

- Out-of-bounds reads: what you get (undefined)
- Accidental gaps when skipping
- Reinforce using only numbers
- Negative numbers don’t “wrap around”

TEACHING TIPS

- Encourage learners to check array length often
- Test and observe what goes wrong themselves

---

**Slide 7**
## Quick practice: predict the result
Slide content

For each, what will be logged?

```javascript
let movies = ['Titanic', 'Inception', 'Avatar'];
movies[2] = 'The Matrix';
console.log(movies);

let pets = ['dog', 'cat'];
pets[pets.length] = 'hamster';
console.log(pets);

let shopping = ['soap'];
shopping[4] = 'toothpaste';
console.log(shopping);
```

- Pause and predict output before running code
- Notice patterns in how arrays react

PURPOSE:
Reinforce learning through immediate, bite-sized practice.

TALKING POINTS

- Encourage thinking before coding
- Each change follows square bracket rules
- Spot undefined when skipping indexes

TEACHING TIPS

- Let learners try in VS Code or browser
- Discuss as a group or pairs

**Slide 8**
## Activity: access, modify, and grow your array
Slide content

Step-by-step challenge:

1. Pick a theme you enjoy (e.g. sports, foods).
2. Create an array with 3+ strings.
3. Print first and last elements using bracket notation.
4. Change second item; print updated array.
5. Add a new item at the end (using length as index).
6. Access a non-existent index and note the result.
7. Share your code and findings with the group.

Deliverable:

- Code for each step
- Printed results
- Short note on surprises or questions

PURPOSE:
Move from examples to creative, applied practice.

TALKING POINTS

- Choose fun, personal themes for engagement
- Bracket notation for all steps
- Observe real array behavior, not just theory

TEACHING TIPS

- Encourage creative/relatable themes
- Remind to print after each step for clarity

- Always use numbers, not strings or negatives

PURPOSE:
Highlight and reinforce the lesson’s main points before moving on.

TALKING POINTS

- Repeat zero-based indexing concept
- Warn about undefined and how to spot it

TEACHING TIPS

- Invite learners to recall and echo key ideas
- Keep summary concise for easy review

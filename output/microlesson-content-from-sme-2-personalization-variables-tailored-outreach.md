# Personalization Variables for Tailored Outreach

**Learning Objective:** Apply the right personalization variables (e.g., role, company size, etc.) to create more tailored and relevant outreach

## Understanding the importance of personalization in sales outreach

Today’s prospects are flooded with messages—most of which are generic, and many go unread. When your emails are tailored to each reader’s needs, priorities, and context, you’re far more likely to capture attention and get a response. Personalization means more than just inserting a first name; it’s about showing that you’ve done your homework and that your message is relevant to the recipient’s business and challenges.

AI-driven sales tools make personalization possible at scale. By leveraging available data and intelligent automation, you can build email sequences that feel one-to-one—even when you’re reaching out to hundreds or thousands of prospects. Effective personalization results in higher open rates, better engagement, and ultimately, more closed deals.

## Identifying key personalization variables

When customizing outreach, it helps to focus on specific, high-impact details about your prospects. These details, known as personalization variables, provide the context your AI tool (and you) need to create relevant emails.

Let’s break down the most valuable variables to consider:

### Role

A prospect’s role within their company directly affects their priorities and the kind of language or information that will resonate with them. For example, messaging that appeals to a CTO will differ from outreach to a Sales Manager.

**Example:**
- For a CTO: Emphasize technical efficiency and system integration.
- For a Sales Manager: Highlight how your solution improves their team’s closing rate.

### Company size

The size of an organization influences workflow, challenges, buying cycles, and budget. Large enterprises may be focused on scalability, while smaller companies need flexibility and may decide faster.

**Example:**
- “We recently helped a 20-person startup triple their productivity using automated reports…” 
- “Global finance leaders like [large enterprise] use our platform to coordinate across 500+ locations worldwide.”

### Industry

Industries have unique pain points, regulations, and success stories. Referencing industry context shows your prospect that you understand their world.

**Example:**
- “In healthcare, data security is critical—we work with providers to streamline HIPAA-compliant communications.”
- “Retailers use our inventory tool to avoid stockouts during holiday surges.”

### Pain points

Addressing known challenges or goals your prospect faces is one of the best ways to demonstrate value and relevance. These insights can come from research, previous interactions, or signals like job postings and news alerts.

**Example:**
- “Saw your team is hiring rapidly—our onboarding tool helps new sales reps ramp up 40% faster.”
- “Noticed you expanded into Europe. We assist with multi-currency invoicing for growth-stage SaaS companies.”

### Additional useful variables

- **Location:** Tailor based on region, local trends, or compliance requirements.
- **Tech stack:** Reference the software or platforms they use.
- **Recent news or events:** Mention a recent award, funding round, leadership change, or product launch.

## Techniques for gathering and organizing personalization data

Personalized outreach depends on having accurate, up-to-date information. Here’s how you can gather and manage the variables you need:

### Leverage your CRM and enrichment tools

Your CRM (Customer Relationship Management) system holds valuable prospect data. Use it to segment lists by role, company size, industry, or other fields.

Enrichment tools like Clearbit, ZoomInfo, and LinkedIn Sales Navigator can automatically pull in missing information, such as company revenue, current technologies, or recent news.

### Use AI-powered research assistants

Some AI tools can scan a prospect’s website, recent press coverage, or social media to extract relevant details—like recent product launches or stated business priorities. Integrating these insights as personalization variables can increase email relevance.

### Organize variables in your outreach platform

Most sales automation tools let you store data fields (variables) that map directly to email templates. Clean, structured data ensures that variables are accurate and used consistently in your campaigns.

**Tip:** Always double-check data for accuracy and set default values for missing variables (for example, “your team” if a specific team name isn’t available).

## Implementing personalization variables in email templates

AI-powered outreach platforms allow you to insert variables dynamically into your message templates, creating custom emails for each recipient without manual rewriting.

### How variable logic works in email templates

Variables are typically inserted in your template using brackets or placeholder syntax, such as:
```
Hi {{first_name}},

I noticed that {{company_name}} has recently expanded its {{industry}} operations...
```
When the email is sent, the platform replaces each placeholder with prospect-specific data from your CRM or spreadsheet.

### Building templates with layers of personalization

You can combine multiple variables in your templates to enhance relevance. For advanced personalization, some platforms let you incorporate conditional statements—for example, using alternate phrasing depending on the recipient's industry.

**Example:**
```
Hi {{first_name}}, 

As a {{job_title}} at a {{company_size}} company in the {{industry}} space, you likely face challenges with {{pain_point}}. We recently helped {similar_company} overcome this by...

Would you be open to a short call next week to explore if this is relevant for {{company_name}}?
```

**Note:** If you’re using an AI writing assistant, you can prompt it to generate content that references the prospect's role, industry, and relevant pain points:
```
Prompt: "Draft a three-sentence email introducing our scheduling tool to a Sales Director at a 200-person financial services company who struggles with slow client onboarding."
```

## Practical exercise: Customizing email templates with personalization variables using AI tools

Now, let’s practice turning data and AI into a more effective email campaign.

### Step-by-step activity: Build and personalize your own outreach template

1. **Segment your prospect list**  
   Choose (or imagine) a list of prospects by role, company size, and industry. You can use real leads from your outreach tool or sample data.

2. **Research one “pain point” for your segment**  
   Use your CRM, enrichment tools, or LinkedIn insights to identify a common challenge faced by this segment.

3. **Draft a basic email template**  
   Write a generic cold email—no personalization yet. Focus on how your solution addresses the challenge you just researched.

4. **Identify places to add personalization variables**  
   Highlight or mark areas in your draft where details like name, company, role, industry, or pain point could make the message more specific.

5. **Insert variables using platform syntax**  
   Convert your draft, swapping generic details for variables (such as {{first_name}}, {{company_name}}, {{job_title}}, or {{pain_point}}).

6. **Prompt an AI writing tool for enhancements**  
   Use your favorite AI assistant (like ChatGPT) and provide your variable-rich template plus a little context:
   - “Take this template and make it more engaging for a CFO at a mid-sized logistics company. Use their name, company, and mention challenges with rapid shipment tracking.”
   - Review and edit the output as needed.

7. **Share your personalized template**  
   Post your finished template—complete with variable placeholders and a sample set of variable values—to the chat or whiteboard.

8. **Reflect on your process**  
   Briefly note which variables you chose, why you picked them, and one thing you noticed about how the AI handled the task.

**Deliverable:**  
Post your AI-augmented, personalized email template to the group discussion area, along with your list of chosen variables and a quick note on their impact.

**Discussion prompt:**  
How do you decide which personalization variables are most important for different prospect segments? After seeing the difference in engagement when emails include role- or pain point-specific details, how will you adjust your outreach strategy going forward?

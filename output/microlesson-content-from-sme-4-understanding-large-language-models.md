# Understanding Large Language Models

**Learning Objective:** Explain how large language models (e.g., ChatGPT) generate text.

## Introduction to large language models and their relevance

Large Language Models (LLMs) are a type of artificial intelligence designed to understand and generate human-like text. They use extensive amounts of data and sophisticated algorithms to predict what comes next in a sequence of words. ChatGPT is a well-known example, developed to chat, answer questions, or generate content on demand.

For HR professionals, the relevance of LLMs goes beyond just tech buzzwords. These models can automate repetitive writing tasks, assist with drafting communications, summarize documents, or even help answer common employee questions. By understanding how LLMs work, you can unlock new efficiencies in recruitment, onboarding, learning and development, and beyond.

## Explanation of basic principles and functioning of LLMs

At its core, a language model looks at language as a sequence of words or tokens. Its main job is to predict the word that should come next. Imagine finishing someone’s sentence in a way that makes sense—language models do that, but at scale and with impressive accuracy.

LLMs such as ChatGPT are built on a type of deep learning called a neural network. Specifically, they use “transformers,” a kind of neural network architecture excellent at handling sequential data like text. Transformers can look at the relationships between words, context, and even long-range dependencies within a sentence or document.

**How does this work in practice?**

Let’s say you input:  
> "Please help me draft a welcome email for a new hire."

The model analyzes what’s been written, reviews its immense archive of similar examples from its training, and predicts the most likely next words to build a complete, appropriate response.

**Analogy:**  
Think of LLMs like very smart auto-complete systems. But instead of just finishing a sentence, they can compose whole paragraphs or answer complex questions based on patterns they learned from data.

## Overview of the training process and data requirements

Training a large language model is a bit like teaching a child to read and write, but on a much larger scale and with much more data. Here’s a breakdown of that process:

- **Data Collection:** LLMs are trained on vast datasets containing books, websites, articles, and more, representing a wide variety of topics, writing styles, and contexts.
- **Tokenization:** The text is broken down into “tokens.” Tokens can be as short as one character or as long as one word.
- **Learning Patterns:** The model processes massive amounts of text, learning which words and phrases typically follow others. It does this billions of times, adjusting the “weights” in its neural network based on whether it guessed correctly.
- **Fine-Tuning:** After the general training, the model undergoes fine-tuning on specific types of documents or conversations, making it better suited for tasks like answering HR-related questions.

**An HR analogy:**  
Imagine onboarding a new team member by showing them thousands of examples of workplace emails, policies, and chats. Over time, they get better at figuring out the best way to communicate in any given situation. LLMs are “onboarded” similarly but at a much larger scale and speed.

## Live demonstration of text generation using ChatGPT

Let’s see what happens when we use ChatGPT for an HR task.

**Prompt Example:**  
> "Generate a response to an employee asking about remote work policy."

**ChatGPT Output Example:**  
> "Hi there! Our current remote work policy allows employees to work from home up to three days per week, provided that job duties permit it and with manager approval. If you’d like to discuss a specific arrangement, please reach out to HR or your team lead."

**What’s happening here?**  
ChatGPT takes the prompt, analyzes its context, and draws on its training data to create a useful, polished response. If you change the prompt slightly, you’ll notice that the model adapts its answer accordingly.

**Customize your prompt:**  
You can make the prompt more detailed:  
> "Draft a friendly and clear email inviting all employees to attend a virtual onboarding session next Friday at 10 a.m."  
ChatGPT will create a well-structured, friendly message matching the tone and context of HR communications.

## Discussion on potential applications of LLMs in HR contexts

Understanding how LLMs generate text opens up several exciting applications for HR teams:

- **Automated drafting:** LLMs can help you draft job descriptions, onboarding emails, or policy updates.
- **FAQs and chatbots:** Use LLMs to power HR chatbots that answer routine employee questions.
- **Resume screening:** Analyze candidate resumes and generate interview questions tailored to specific roles.
- **Training and documentation:** Summarize training materials or create personalized learning paths for employees.

**Example in action:**  
Imagine a chatbot answering an employee's PTO question:

> Employee: "How many vacation days do I have left this year?"  
> LLM-powered chatbot: "According to our records, you have 5 vacation days remaining for the current calendar year. Feel free to reach out if you need help booking time off!"

By integrating LLMs thoughtfully, you can boost productivity, reduce manual workload, and improve the employee experience.

## Activity: Partner exercise—practice prompt engineering for HR scenarios

1. **Pair up with a partner in your virtual classroom or breakout room.**
2. **Each of you selects an HR-related scenario (for example, responding to a candidate, explaining a benefits policy, or providing feedback).**
3. **Together, craft a clear prompt you would use with ChatGPT to generate the necessary text for your chosen scenario. Try to be as specific as possible, thinking about tone, audience, and context.**
4. **Post your prompt in the group chat.**
5. **Run your prompt through ChatGPT or a similar LLM, then review and discuss the generated response with your partner.**
6. **Together, revise your prompt to improve the response if needed (for clarity, appropriateness, or tone).**
7. **Share your final, improved prompt and the LLM-generated response with the class. Be prepared to discuss why you made specific adjustments and how this process supports more effective HR communication.**

**Discussion prompt:**  
Reflect on the exercise:  
How did adjusting your prompt change the quality or relevance of the LLM’s response? What applications can you envision for prompt engineering in your daily HR work, and what guidelines will you use when crafting prompts to ensure clarity and effectiveness?

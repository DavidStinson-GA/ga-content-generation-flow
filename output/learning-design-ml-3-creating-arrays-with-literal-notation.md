# Creating arrays with literal notation

**Learning Objective:** Create arrays using JavaScript literal notation.

## Syntax for array literal notation

So far, you‚Äôve learned that arrays are like organizers for groups of information, similar to a row of cubbyholes or storage boxes‚Äîeach box holds an item, all together in one neat row.

The most common way to create an array in JavaScript is with *array literal notation*. This means writing the array directly into your code, placing your values inside square brackets (`[ ]`), separated by commas.

Here‚Äôs what that looks like:

```javascript
let colors = ['red', 'green', 'blue'];
```

Let‚Äôs break this down step by step:

- The `let` keyword declares a new variable (a named container for your data).
- The variable name `colors` describes what the array will store.
- The square brackets define the array. Each value inside (like `'red'`, `'green'`, and `'blue'`) is called an *element*, and elements are separated by commas.

> üìö An *element* is an individual item stored at a specific position in an array.

### Key points to remember

- Arrays are defined with square brackets `[ ]`.
- Elements in the array are separated by commas.
- You can use either `let` or `const` to declare an array. Use `const` if the variable will not be reassigned to a different array.

> üèÜ Best practice: Pick clear, descriptive names for your arrays so you (and others) will quickly understand what each group of data represents.

## Creating arrays with different data types

You might notice that arrays aren‚Äôt limited to only words (strings). JavaScript arrays can hold any type of value‚Äîeven mixing different types in one array. This flexibility helps you experiment and solve a variety of challenges.

Here are some practical examples:

**Array of numbers**

```javascript
let ages = [22, 34, 28, 41];
```

**Array of strings**

```javascript
let pets = ['cat', 'bird', 'hamster'];
```

**Array with mixed data types**

```javascript
let randomThings = [42, 'hello', true, null];
```

**Arrays containing other arrays or objects (for advanced use cases)**

```javascript
let nestedArray = [['apple', 'banana'], ['carrot', 'pea']];
let personDetails = ['Amira', 29, false];
```

> üí° While it‚Äôs possible to mix data types in a single array, in most programs, it‚Äôs best to store similar kinds of information together to keep your code clean and easy to work with.

## Empty arrays and their uses

Often when building programs, you might not know every item your array should hold right away. You might need to collect data from users, or grow a list over time as your program runs.

To do this, you can start with an *empty array* using literal notation‚Äîjust two square brackets with nothing inside:

```javascript
let emptyList = [];
```

> üìö An *empty array* is an array with zero elements, ready to have items added later.

You can add elements to your array as your program runs. For example:

```javascript
let numbers = [];
numbers.push(5);
numbers.push(10);
console.log(numbers);
// Prints: [5, 10]
```

> üí° The `.push()` method adds a new element to the end of an array.

**Real-world uses for empty arrays:**

- Collecting user responses over time (like survey answers or registrations)
- Building a task list as new tasks arrive
- Tracking items added to a shopping cart

## Practical examples of array creation

Let‚Äôs look at a few scenarios you might encounter in day-to-day life or work:

**Example 1: To-do list**

Suppose you want to make a checklist of tasks for the day.

```javascript
let todoList = ['Check messages', 'Plan schedule', 'Write summary'];
```

**Example 2: List of favorite movies**

Imagine keeping a simple catalog of films you enjoy.

```javascript
let favoriteMovies = ['Song of the Sea', 'Spirited Away', 'The Lunchbox'];
```

**Example 3: Collecting survey answers**

If you‚Äôre building a quick survey, you may want to store each person‚Äôs answer as they respond.

```javascript
let responses = [];
responses.push('Yes');
responses.push('No');
console.log(responses);
// Prints: ['Yes', 'No']
```

> üí° Arrays, especially those created with literal notation, are your digital notepads‚Äîflexible, organized, and always ready for new data.

## Activity: Hands-on with array literal notation

### Purpose

Practice creating arrays using literal notation, adding to arrays, and connecting code to relatable, real-world ideas. This helps you become comfortable using one of JavaScript‚Äôs most common data structures.

### Instructions

1. **Open your code editor**

   - Use Visual Studio Code or an online JavaScript editor such as repl.it or JSFiddle.

2. **Create an array of your top three travel destinations**

   - Think of three places you would love to visit from anywhere in the world.
   - Use array literal notation to create an array named `travelDestinations`, placing each destination as a string.

   Example:

   ```javascript
   let travelDestinations = ['Cairo', 'Rio de Janeiro', 'Kyoto'];
   ```

3. **Print your array to the console**

   - Use `console.log()` to show your `travelDestinations` array.

   ```javascript
   console.log(travelDestinations);
   // Prints: ['Cairo', 'Rio de Janeiro', 'Kyoto']
   ```

4. **Create an empty array for future trips**

   - Declare an empty array named `futureTrips`.
   - Print it to confirm it is empty.

   ```javascript
   let futureTrips = [];
   console.log(futureTrips);
   // Prints: []
   ```

5. **Add a destination to your empty array**

   - Use the `.push()` method to add a new place to `futureTrips`.
   - Print `futureTrips` again to watch it change.

   ```javascript
   futureTrips.push('Seoul');
   console.log(futureTrips);
   // Prints: ['Seoul']
   ```

6. **Deliverable**

   - Share your code snippet (or a screenshot of your code and output) with your learning group.

> üèÜ Best practice: Use personal and diverse examples for your arrays, reflecting interests, backgrounds, or places that inspire you.

## Discussion prompt

When would you want to start with an empty array rather than one filled with items? Share ways an empty array is useful for a real-world application you use or would like to create‚Äîfor example, trip planning, a shopping cart for online purchases, or storing responses to a quiz. Share your thoughts with your group and discuss how empty arrays make programs more adaptable and user-friendly.

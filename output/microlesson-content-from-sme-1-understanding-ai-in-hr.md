# Understanding AI in HR

**Learning Objective:** Differentiate between different types of AI in the HR space.

## Introduction to AI and its relevance in HR

Artificial intelligence (AI) is transforming the workplace, and human resources (HR) is no exception. As HR professionals, you're constantly searching for ways to work more efficiently and make smarter decisions—from screening resumes to improving employee engagement. AI offers tools that can help automate repetitive tasks, analyze large sets of data, and make recommendations, all of which free you up to focus on the "human" side of HR.

Let’s break it down: AI refers to computer systems that can perform tasks typically requiring human intelligence, such as recognizing speech, understanding language, and learning from data. In HR, AI can help with everything from sourcing candidates faster, predicting employee turnover, to personalizing learning and development.

## Different types of AI: An overview

AI isn't just one technology. There are several types that each play unique roles in HR. Understanding their distinctions helps you choose and use the right tools for your needs.

### Machine learning

**What is it?**
Machine learning (ML) is a type of AI that allows computers to learn from data without being explicitly programmed. Essentially, the system looks for patterns and makes predictions or decisions based on historical information.

**How does it work in HR?**
In HR, machine learning can analyze piles of resumes or employee data to uncover patterns—like which attributes are common among top performers—or predict things like which employees are most likely to leave based on historical turnover data.

**Example scenario:**  
Imagine you have years’ worth of employee records, including performance reviews and tenure. A machine learning model could learn what high-performing employees have in common, then suggest which new candidates are most likely to perform well.

**Analogy:**  
Think of ML as a worker who learns on the job. The more examples they see, the better they get at recognizing what makes a candidate successful or likely to stay at your organization.

### Natural language processing (NLP)

**What is it?**
Natural language processing enables computers to read, interpret, and generate human language. This lets AI interact with us through text or speech—think chatbots or automated email responders.

**How does it work in HR?**
In HR, NLP powers tools that read resumes, sort emails, or even answer questions from candidates automatically. It also helps analyze employee feedback from surveys by summarizing and identifying trends hidden in large volumes of open-ended responses.

**Example scenario:**  
During recruitment, instead of manually reading hundreds of cover letters, you might use an AI tool that uses NLP to scan the letters for specific competencies or experiences and flag the top matches.

**Analogy:**  
NLP is like giving your HR system the ability to "read" and "listen" so it can filter information or interact with users directly, just as a human would.

### Computer vision

**What is it?**
Computer vision enables computers to interpret visual information from the world—like photos, videos, or even handwriting. While less common in HR, it has exciting applications, especially as digital interviews and remote onboarding become more widespread.

**How does it work in HR?**
One notable use is in video interviewing platforms, where computer vision can help transcribe spoken responses, monitor engagement, or detect if someone is present during remote proctoring scenarios. However, it's vital to use these features responsibly and with attention to fairness and privacy.

**Example scenario:**  
Some companies use AI to analyze recorded video interviews, helping HR teams summarize responses and assess facial expressions to gauge candidate engagement.

**Analogy:**  
Think of computer vision as giving your HR programs "eyes"—they can see and interpret images or video, just as you would when reviewing a candidate’s recorded interview.

## Comparing AI types in HR: Practical examples

It’s crucial to know where each AI type shines. Here’s a quick comparison:

| AI Type                | Typical Use in HR                                      | Example Tool/Activity                   |
|------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------|
| Machine Learning       | Predicting employee turnover, identifying talent       | Attrition prediction dashboards, resume scoring |
| Natural Language Processing (NLP) | Screening applications, processing surveys, Q&A chatbots | Chatbots for FAQs, resume parsing       |
| Computer Vision        | Video interview analysis, onboarding ID verification    | Automated interview summary platforms   |

### HR scenario breakdown

- **Sourcing & Screening Candidates:**  
  *ML* can learn patterns from previous successful hires; *NLP* parses keywords and themes from resumes; *Computer Vision* might validate candidate identity via ID uploads.
- **Employee Engagement:**  
  *NLP* analyzes text feedback from surveys; *ML* identifies predictors of disengagement in engagement data.
- **Onboarding:**  
  *NLP*-powered chatbots answer new hire questions 24/7; *Computer Vision* verifies paperwork or tracks completion of video training.

## How distinctions among AI types impact HR roles

Understanding which type of AI a tool uses helps shape your expectations and strategy:

- **Adoption:**  
  If you know a tool uses ML, you’ll know it will improve with more, high-quality historical data. For NLP, you’ll prioritize clear language in documents and communications to ensure accurate analysis.
- **Ethics and fairness:**  
  Being clear on AI types lets you assess potential biases. For instance, ML models can inherit biases in training data, and Computer Vision can struggle with diverse facial features if not properly designed.
- **Collaboration:**  
  HR might need to collaborate with IT or data teams differently depending on the AI type. For NLP-related projects, you’ll focus on collecting robust, representative language samples. For Computer Vision tools, you might need to consider privacy laws more closely.

## Activity: Matching HR scenarios to AI types

### Exercise instructions

1. You’ll see several HR scenarios listed below.
2. For each one, decide which type(s) of AI—Machine Learning, Natural Language Processing, or Computer Vision—would be best suited to address the challenge.
3. Post your responses in the classroom chat, along with a brief explanation for each choice.
4. Be prepared to engage in a group discussion where you’ll compare how you and your peers approached the scenarios.

**Scenarios:**

- A tool that sorts applicants based on both work history and open-text recommendations.
- An onboarding assistant that answers new employees’ questions and schedules meetings via chat.
- An app that processes video interviews and summarizes facial expressions and attention levels for hiring managers.

**Group discussion prompt:**  
After completing the activity, reflect together on this question:  
*"Why is it important for HR professionals to understand the differences between types of AI when choosing and implementing HR technology? How might this influence your approach to tool selection and employee communications?"*

**Deliverable:**  
Share your AI type matches and reasoning in the chat, and be ready to participate in a shared discussion summarizing key learnings from your choices.

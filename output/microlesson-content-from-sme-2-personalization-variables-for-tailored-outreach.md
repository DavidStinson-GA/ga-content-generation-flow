# Personalization Variables for Tailored Outreach

**Learning Objective:** Apply the right personalization variables (such as role, company size, and more) to create more tailored and relevant outreach

## Understanding the importance of personalization in sales outreach

In modern sales, sending the same generic email to every potential customer rarely leads to meaningful connections. People want to feel understood—they’re much more likely to engage with messages that address their unique role, challenges, or goals. Personalization takes your outreach beyond just using a prospect’s name. It’s about delivering messages that speak directly to their needs and context.

Personalized outreach shows your prospects that you’ve done your homework and that your offering is relevant to what matters most to them. This makes your outreach stand out, increasing open rates, response rates, and your chances of moving deals forward.

Let’s revisit what we learned previously: With AI-enhanced outreach, personalization goes beyond manual editing. We can now use data and automated processes to make every touchpoint feel individualized, even at scale.

## Identifying key personalization variables

Not all details about a prospect are equally valuable. The key is focusing on variables that actually impact their decision-making process and how your solution fits into their world. Here are some of the most effective personalization variables for sales outreach:

### Role or job title

The challenges and priorities of a CEO differ significantly from those of a Marketing Manager. By identifying a recipient's specific role, you can tailor the messaging to their everyday pain points and goals.

**Example:**  
A Sales Director might care more about increasing pipeline velocity, while an IT Director may be focused on security or system integration.

### Company size

Small businesses often have tighter budgets but faster decision cycles. Enterprises may look for scalability, advanced analytics, or integration with existing systems. Personalizing for company size ensures you emphasize benefits that align with their operating reality.

**Example:**  
Highlighting cost savings might resonate more with a startup, while an enterprise buyer may be more interested in compliance or cross-team collaboration features.

### Industry or vertical

Industry-specific challenges and regulations influence the buying process. Messaging that references industry trends or uses sector-specific language signals expertise.

**Example:**  
You might mention HIPAA compliance when writing to a healthcare company, or discuss e-commerce conversion rates when reaching out to online retailers.

### Pain points or recent activity

Identifying a contact’s pain points shows you understand their situation. You might surface these from recent news, company announcements, or even past conversations.

**Example:**  
Referencing a recent funding round, a product launch, or a known challenge (like integrating remote teams) immediately makes your outreach more compelling.

### Location

While sometimes less critical, localization can make outreach more relatable—like referencing local regulations or events.

**Example:**  
Offering to meet up at a regional conference or mentioning recent changes to state-level regulations.

### Previous engagement or history

If a prospect has already interacted with your company—by downloading a resource or requesting a demo—reference that in your outreach.

**Example:**  
“I saw you recently attended our webinar on AI in sales—would you like a deeper dive into how this could help your team?”

## Techniques for gathering and organizing personalization data

Having the right variables is only useful if you can gather and use them efficiently. Here’s how you can do this:

### Using LinkedIn, company websites, and social platforms

Most roles, company sizes, and industries can be determined from LinkedIn profiles or company websites. Take note of recent news, posts, or shared articles to unearth pain points or priorities.

### Leveraging CRM and enrichment tools

CRM systems (like Salesforce or HubSpot) store past interactions and firmographic data. Enrichment tools, such as Clearbit or ZoomInfo, automatically add missing data points like industry or company size.

### Organizing with tags and custom fields

Keeping organized is key. Use custom fields in your CRM or sales engagement platform to store variables for each contact. Consider tagging contacts by major variables to make segmentation and personalization simpler.

**Analogy:**  
Think of your contact list as a library. Every book (contact) is cataloged by genre (industry), author (role), publication year (company size), and special notes—all making it easier to find and reach the right audience.

## Using AI to analyze and suggest optimal personalization strategies

AI tools can help you sift through large databases, identify useful personalization variables, and even suggest tailored messaging strategies. Here are some ways AI supercharges personalization:

### Automated data extraction

AI scrapes and summarizes details from public profiles, recent news, or prior interactions—giving you a list of actionable variables without the need for manual research.

### Segment analysis

AI looks for patterns in past outreach performance. It might tell you that your outreach to “VPs in healthcare companies with 500+ employees” yields the best results, suggesting you personalize more deeply for this group.

### Variable-driven content suggestions

Tools like ChatGPT can generate draft emails using input about the recipient (role, industry, pain point). You provide key details, and the AI tailors language, value propositions, and even subject lines.

**Example prompt for AI-generated emails:**

```
Write a follow-up email to {{prospect_name}}, a {{role}} at {{company_name}}, mentioning their recent product launch and how our solution helps companies in the {{industry}} scale new offerings faster.
```

The AI will substitute the variables and craft unique, relevant content—saving time and boosting engagement.

## Implementing personalized variables in outreach campaigns

Once you’ve gathered and organized your personalization data, the next step is to use these variables within your outreach platform and campaigns.

### Dynamic fields in email templates

Most sales engagement platforms allow you to include dynamic fields (sometimes called merge tags or variables) in your email templates. This means the platform will fill in details—like the contact’s name, company, or specific pain point—when sending each message.

**Example template (with variables):**

```
Subject: Helping {{company_name}} achieve better results in {{industry}}

Hi {{prospect_name}},

As a {{role}} at {{company_name}}, you know how challenging it can be to {{pain_point}}. Here’s how we’ve helped businesses like yours...

Best,
{{sender_name}}
```

### Testing and iterating

Start simple: personalize with role and company name. As you get comfortable, add more advanced variables like industry references or recent activities. With AI and analytics, you can test which variables drive the best responses and optimize your templates accordingly.

### Scaling with automation

By storing the right data and using dynamic variables, you can launch tailored campaigns to hundreds (or thousands) of prospects in just a few clicks—combining the efficiency of automation with the impact of true personalization.

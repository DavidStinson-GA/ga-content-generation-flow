# Creating Arrays in JavaScript

**Learning Objective:**  
Create arrays using JavaScript literal notation.

## Introduction

Arrays are a critical building block in JavaScript programming—think of them as organized lists or containers that help you keep related data grouped together. If you’ve ever made a list of groceries or organized a playlist of songs, you already understand the basic principle! In this lesson, you’ll learn how to create your own arrays using JavaScript’s most common and beginner-friendly approach: array literal notation.

By the end of this lesson, you’ll be able to:
- Use square brackets `[ ]` to create arrays.
- Make arrays with items like numbers, words, or even a mix.
- Start with an empty array or fill it up from the beginning.
- Recognize how array creation fits into larger JavaScript programs.

## Array literal notation: Square brackets []

JavaScript makes it easy to create an array—just put your values between square brackets (`[ ]`) and separate them with commas. This method is called **array literal notation**.

**Think of the square brackets as a box, and the items inside are what you’re storing in the box.**

**Syntax Example:**

```javascript
let fruits = ["apple", "banana", "cherry"];
```

- `let` is a keyword to create a new variable.
- `fruits` is the name we chose for our array.
- `["apple", "banana", "cherry"]` is the new array: a list of three string values.

**How it works:**
- You can list any number of items.
- Each value (called an element) is separated by a comma.
- Items are stored in a particular order, which is important later on.

**Visual description:**  
Picture a row of small, labeled boxes—each holding an item from your list, and all lined up together.

## Creating arrays with different data types

Arrays are flexible! You can fill them with numbers, strings (text), or even a mix of both. While it’s common practice to group similar types of data for clarity, JavaScript doesn’t require this.

**1. Array of numbers:**

```javascript
let ages = [21, 34, 56, 18, 42];
```

**2. Array of strings:**

```javascript
let favoriteBooks = ["1984", "To Kill a Mockingbird", "Moby Dick"];
```

**3. Mixed-type array (possible but use with care):**

```javascript
let mixedArray = [42, "blue", true, null];
```

- This array holds a number (`42`), a string (`"blue"`), a boolean (`true`), and a special value, `null`.
- In professional programming, it’s best to keep data types consistent for predictability, but it’s good to know arrays can be this flexible.

**Analogy:**  
Imagine a toolbox: You might want just wrenches (numbers) in one box, screwdrivers (strings) in another, but sometimes you need a box with a little bit of everything for a specific job.

## Empty arrays vs. arrays with initial values

When you create an array, you have two main choices:
1. **Start with an empty array and add items later.**
2. **Start with an array already filled with some values.**

**1. Creating an empty array:**

```javascript
let todoList = [];
```

- The array exists, but it doesn’t have any items yet.
- You can add items one at a time later using methods like `.push()` (which you’ll learn more about soon).

**2. Creating an array with initial values:**

```javascript
let morningRoutine = ["Wake up", "Brush teeth", "Make coffee"];
```

- This array starts off with three items.

**When to use each approach:**

- **Empty array:** Use this if you won’t know what items you need ahead of time, or if you’ll be collecting them as your program runs (like asking a user for input).
- **Pre-filled array:** Use this if you already know what you need, right from the start.

**Real-world analogy:**  
- An empty suitcase is ready for packing.
- A full suitcase is ready to travel immediately!

## Practical examples of array creation

Let’s look at some practical, real-life inspired arrays that you might create as a beginner.

**Example 1: A shopping list**

```javascript
let shoppingList = ["milk", "eggs", "bread"];
```
- This is a list of strings, each representing an item you need to buy.

**Example 2: Employee ID numbers**

```javascript
let employeeIDs = [1024, 1045, 1107, 1123];
```
- Here, each number represents a unique ID assigned to an employee.

**Example 3: Mixed data for a quick note**

```javascript
let note = ["Call mom", 3, false];
```
- The first element is what you need to do, the second could be how many days left, and the third says if it’s done (`false` means it’s not).

**Visual scenario:**  
Imagine you are an office assistant and need to keep a list of tasks for the day, the names of callers or clients, and deadlines. Arrays let you store all this information in easily accessible, organized lists.

## Activity: Create Your Own Arrays (Solo Exercise)

**Objective:**  
Practice creating arrays using literal notation in JavaScript. Explore making both empty arrays and arrays with initial values made up of different data types.

### Step-by-step instructions

1. **Think of two categories of lists from your everyday life or professional interests** (for example, favorite meals, monthly expenses, team member names, daily moods, gym exercises).
    - One list should be filled in with items (e.g., exercises).
    - One should start out empty (e.g., a list to record new recipes you try this month).

2. **Open a JavaScript editor** (such as [JSFiddle](https://jsfiddle.net/), [CodePen](https://codepen.io/), or your computer’s code editor).

3. **Create two arrays:**
    - One empty array.
    - One array pre-filled with at least three items. Items can be all strings, all numbers, or a mix.

    **Example:**

    ```javascript
    // Starting an empty array for new recipes
    let newRecipes = [];

    // Pre-filled array of favorite exercises
    let favoriteExercises = ["Push-ups", "Jogging", "Yoga"];
    ```

4. **Add a comment to each line** briefly explaining what your array represents.

5. **Display both arrays in the console output** using `console.log()`.

    **Example:**

    ```javascript
    console.log(newRecipes);         // Expect: []
    console.log(favoriteExercises);  // Expect: ["Push-ups", "Jogging", "Yoga"]
    ```

6. **Write a brief reflection** (1-2 sentences) describing:
    - Why you chose each type of array (empty or pre-filled).
    - In what situation each kind would be most useful for you.

### Deliverable

- Post your code snippets and your brief reflection to the class chat or virtual whiteboard.

### Discussion prompt

Arrays aren’t just for code—they’re a way to structure and manage information in your daily routines and work. After completing the exercise, consider this:  
**Think about a situation where starting with an empty array is best, versus a situation where starting with a pre-filled array is better. How could this flexibility help you adapt your list management or planning in real life?**  
Share your thoughts with the group, and read two classmates’ posts. Respond to at least one, offering an example from your own experience or a new scenario where arrays could make things easier.

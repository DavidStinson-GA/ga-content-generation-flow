# Understanding AI in HR

**Learning Objective:** Differentiate between different types of AI in the HR space.

## Introduction to AI and its relevance in HR

Artificial intelligence (*AI*) is transforming many aspects of the workplace, including human resources (*HR*). As HR professionals, you are continually exploring ways to increase efficiency and make informed decisions—whether it is screening resumes, improving employee engagement, or designing professional development initiatives.

AI can power tools that automate repetitive tasks, analyze large volumes of data, and provide recommendations, freeing up more time to focus on building meaningful relationships and supporting employees.

> 📚 *Artificial intelligence (AI)* is when computer systems are designed to perform tasks that typically require human intelligence, such as recognizing speech, understanding written language, or identifying trends in data.

HR teams increasingly adopt AI to:
- Source and screen job candidates more efficiently,
- Predict employee turnover,
- Personalize learning and development opportunities,
- Interpret feedback and engagement data.

## Different types of AI: An overview

AI encompasses several types of technologies, each suited to specific uses in HR. Understanding the strengths and limitations of each allows you to select tools that match your objectives and workplace needs.

### Machine learning

**What is it?**

*Machine learning (ML)* is a type of AI where computer systems learn to recognize patterns in data and make predictions, without being specifically programmed for those outcomes.

> 💡 Think of machine learning as a new colleague who, over time, starts to recognize what makes someone successful in your organization—by reviewing historical data and learning from previous examples.

**How does it work in HR?**

In HR, machine learning applications can:
- Analyze candidate information and resumes to spot trends among high-performing employees,
- Predict which employees may be at risk of leaving based on past patterns, 
- Help identify the characteristics of successful new hires using data from previous hiring rounds.

**Relatable example:**

Suppose your organization has several years of employee performance reviews, turnover data, and success metrics. A machine learning system can sort through all this, find commonalities among high performers, and help score incoming candidates based on these factors.

### Natural language processing (NLP)

**What is it?**

*Natural language processing (NLP)* is a branch of AI that enables computers to understand, interpret, and generate natural human language—whether that’s written text or spoken words.

> 💡 Imagine NLP as a skilled HR assistant who can quickly scan and summarize hundreds of resumes, emails, or survey responses, identifying the key points you would have picked out yourself.

**How does it work in HR?**

NLP tools can:
- Read and flag resumes with specific skills or keywords,
- Sort or automatically respond to emails from candidates,
- Summarize employee feedback collected from engagement surveys,
- Power chatbots that answer employee questions in real time.

**Relatable example:**

During recruitment, an NLP-powered tool might scan hundreds of job applications, highlight those containing certain skills or experiences, and summarize the main themes from candidates’ cover letters.

### Computer vision

**What is it?**

*Computer vision* enables computers to understand and analyze visual information—such as photos or video recordings.

> 💡 Think of computer vision as giving your HR technology “eyes”—it can watch a video interview, notice if the interviewee is present and attentive, and even transcribe spoken responses.

**How does it work in HR?**

While less common, computer vision tools are increasingly used in:
- Video interview platforms (e.g., analyzing facial expressions or engagement),
- Identity verification during remote onboarding,
- Transcribing video responses for analysis.

**Relatable example:**

You may use a video interview platform where the system summarizes candidate responses or notes whether candidates remain present during the call. This ensures a fairer and more efficient review, but it’s important to handle this technology with great care for privacy and fairness.

> ⚠ When using computer vision tools, always be transparent with candidates and employees, and ensure compliance with relevant privacy guidelines.

## Comparing AI types in HR: Practical examples

Each type of AI technology is suited to different HR challenges. Understanding how they compare helps you make strategic decisions.

| AI Type                | Typical Use in HR                                      | Example Tool/Activity                   |
|------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------|
| Machine Learning       | Predicting employee turnover, identifying talent       | Attrition prediction dashboards, resume scoring |
| Natural Language Processing (NLP) | Screening applications, processing surveys, Q&A chatbots | Chatbots for FAQs, resume parsing       |
| Computer Vision        | Video interview analysis, onboarding ID verification    | Automated interview summary platforms   |

> 😎 You can use this table as a reference when selecting HR tools—matching your HR need to the underlying AI technology helps you ask the right questions and set realistic expectations.

### HR scenario breakdown

Let’s look at how the three types of AI can support common HR activities:

- **Sourcing & Screening Candidates:**  
  - *Machine learning*: Recognizes patterns among successful hires and scores applicants accordingly.
  - *Natural language processing*: Highlights resumes or cover letters mentioning required competencies.
  - *Computer vision*: Validates candidate identity if they upload a photo ID.
- **Employee Engagement:**  
  - *Natural language processing*: Analyzes open-text feedback for recurring trends.
  - *Machine learning*: Identifies predictors of disengagement in engagement data.
- **Onboarding:**  
  - *Natural language processing*: Chatbots respond instantly to new hire questions.
  - *Computer vision*: Verifies completion of required training modules via video.

> 💡 Many leading organizations use combinations of these tools for maximum efficiency—for example, an AI chatbot (NLP) might gather onboarding questions, while a machine learning system tracks which new hires may need additional support.

## How distinctions among AI types impact HR roles

Knowing which form of AI a tool uses helps you choose, implement, and manage new technology effectively.

- **Adoption:**  
  - *Machine learning* tools need plenty of accurate, relevant historical data to be most effective.
  - *Natural language processing* benefits from clear, well-written documents and communications.
  - *Computer vision* may require planning to address privacy and accessibility considerations.
- **Ethics and fairness:**  
  - Bias in data can affect machine learning results, possibly disadvantaging particular groups.
  - Computer vision must be evaluated for equitable treatment across diverse populations.
- **Collaboration:**  
  - You may need to work more closely with IT or data teams depending on the type of AI—to provide robust data sets for ML, or to assess privacy compliance for computer vision projects.

> ⚠ Always check your organization’s policies and relevant legal requirements when introducing AI tools, especially when handling sensitive information or personal data.

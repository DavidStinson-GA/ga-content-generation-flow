# Personalization Variables for Tailored Outreach

**Learning Objective:** Apply the right personalization variables (for example, role, company size) to create more tailored and relevant outreach

---

## Understanding the importance of personalization in sales outreach

If you have ever sent outreach emails, you likely know how many go unopened or ignored‚Äîoften because they do not speak directly to the recipient‚Äôs context. Personalization is not just about using someone‚Äôs first name; it is about showing relevance. When your messages connect to a prospect‚Äôs unique business, challenges, or recent developments, you demonstrate understanding and increase the chance of a response.

Thanks to AI-driven sales tools, it is now possible to personalize hundreds or thousands of emails efficiently. By using data and intelligent automation, you can build outreach that feels personal and aligned with each recipient‚Äôs situation.

> üí° When personalization is done well, your emails stand out in a crowded inbox, leading to more opens, replies, and closed deals.

## Identifying key personalization variables

To create relevant outreach, focus on specific details about each prospect. These details, called *personalization variables*, help you and your AI assistant build tailored messages at scale.

Here are the most valuable variables to consider, with practical examples:

### Role

A prospect's role within their organization shapes what matters most to them.

**Examples:**

- For someone in a technical leadership position: Highlight system integration, reduction in manual tasks, or workflow automation.
- For someone leading a sales team: Emphasize increased closing rates or how your solution frees up more time for customer engagement.

### Company size

The size of a company affects its challenges, decision-making process, and focus.

**Examples:**

- ‚ÄúWe worked with a small technology firm to help them track productivity as the team grew.‚Äù
- ‚ÄúInternational firms with large teams rely on our platform to streamline communication across locations and time zones.‚Äù

### Industry

Different industries face distinct challenges and operate within unique constraints.

**Examples:**

- In health services: ‚ÄúSecure and compliant communication is crucial, so we support organizations navigating strict data privacy regulations.‚Äù
- In retail: ‚ÄúManaging inventory cycles during high-demand periods? Our tools help global stores avoid emptier shelves when demand spikes.‚Äù

### Pain points

Directly referencing a *pain point*‚Äîa challenge or goal known to affect your prospect‚Äîshows your outreach is not generic.

**Examples:**

- ‚ÄúGrowing your workforce rapidly? Our training solution shortens new hire onboarding by 35%.‚Äù
- ‚ÄúExpanding to new regions? We have supported companies with multi-currency invoicing across continents.‚Äù

### Additional useful variables

- **Location:** Adjust your message to fit regional regulations or trends.
- **Tech stack:** Mention software or technology the company uses, showing you have done your research.
- **Recent news or events:** Refer to a prospect‚Äôs new product launch, award, or expansion.

> üìö *Personalization variables* are specific pieces of information about a prospect (such as their role, company size, or challenges) used to tailor communication for better engagement.

## Techniques for gathering and organizing personalization data

Effective personalization depends on having reliable, up-to-date information about your prospects. Here are practical ways to find and organize these variables:

### Leverage your CRM and enrichment tools

Your *Customer Relationship Management* (CRM) platform stores key details about leads, such as role, company size, or last contact date. Enrichment tools‚Äîlike Clearbit, ZoomInfo, or LinkedIn Sales Navigator‚Äîcan automatically fill in missing gaps, such as company revenue or most recent announcement.

> üèÜ Keep your CRM data organized and updated. Accurate data helps your AI assistant create reliable, relevant outreach.

### Use AI-powered research assistants

Some AI tools scan public sources (company websites, press releases, or social media) to extract relevant details, such as a recent award or new office opening. These findings can be mapped to personalization variables in your outreach.

### Organize variables in your outreach platform

Most outreach automation tools let you structure your data fields and sync them with your email templates. Consistency and accuracy are essential‚Äîmismatched or missing data can cost you credibility.

> üí° Set *default values* for any personalization variable you might be missing. For example, use "your organization" if the company name is unavailable. This prevents awkward, incomplete sentences in your emails.

## Implementing personalization variables in email templates

AI-powered platforms allow you to insert variables automatically in your message templates, creating unique emails for each recipient‚Äîwithout rewriting each message.

### How variable logic works in email templates

Variables are typically added using a placeholder system, for example:

```
Hi {{first_name}},

I noticed that {{company_name}} recently expanded in the {{industry}} sector...
```

When the email is sent, the system replaces each variable (such as `{{first_name}}`) with the correct prospect data, creating a message that feels personal.

### Building templates with layers of personalization

You can include multiple variables in your template for maximum relevance. Many platforms support *conditional logic*, which changes your message depending on which variables are present, or the value of certain fields.

**Advanced example:**

```
Hi {{first_name}},

As a {{job_title}} at a {{company_size}} company in the {{industry}} sector, you may be facing {{pain_point}}. We helped {{similar_company}} solve this challenge with our platform.

Would you be open to a short call to explore if this is a fit for {{company_name}}?
```

### Using an AI assistant to enhance template personalization

You can prompt your AI assistant to reference multiple variables when composing or improving your email drafts.

**Prompt example:**

```
Draft a brief, compelling email introducing our scheduling software to a Logistics Manager at a mid-sized distribution firm who is struggling to keep shipment records organized.
```

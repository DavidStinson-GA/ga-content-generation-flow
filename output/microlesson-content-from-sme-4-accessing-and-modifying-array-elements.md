# Accessing and Modifying Array Elements

**Learning Objective:**  
Access and modify elements within an array using square brackets.

## Using square bracket notation to access elements

Arrays in JavaScript are like organized shelves, where each item (element) sits in its own slot. To reach into a specific slot and pull out the item you need, you use what is called *square bracket notation*. This is a key feature of how arrays are used in virtually all programming languages.

**How does square bracket notation work?**

When you want to access an element in an array, you write the name of the array, followed by square brackets containing the *index number* of the item:

```javascript
let colors = ["red", "green", "blue"];
console.log(colors[0]); // Outputs: "red"
console.log(colors[1]); // Outputs: "green"
```

- `colors[0]` gives you the first item in the array, which is "red".
- `colors[1]` gives you the second item, "green".

**Why is this useful?**

Instead of having separate variables for each color, you have a *single* variable (`colors`), and you can grab any color you want by specifying its position inside the brackets.

## Zero-based indexing in practice

When talking about array positions, it's important to remember that JavaScript starts counting at zero. This is called **zero-based indexing**. The *first* element is at position 0, the *second* at position 1, and so on.

**Visual Example:**

| Index | 0    | 1      | 2     |
|-------|------|--------|-------|
| Value | red  | green  | blue  |

- `colors[0]` → "red"
- `colors[1]` → "green"
- `colors[2]` → "blue"

Even though there are three items, their positions are 0, 1, and 2. 

**Tip for beginners:**  
This might feel unnatural if you’re used to starting counts at 1 in everyday life. With programming, get into the habit of thinking “zero means the first thing.”

**Practical scenario:**  
Imagine you're organizing conference rooms numbered 101, 102, and 103, but your list in JavaScript would be accessed as `[0]`, `[1]`, `[2]`—like starting at room "zero"!

## Modifying existing array elements

Arrays are not just for storing information—they’re for changing it, too! If you realize you need to update an item in your array, you don’t need to create a whole new array. You can simply change the value at a specific position, again using square brackets.

**How to modify an array element:**

You use the assignment operator (`=`) and specify the index you want to change.

```javascript
let shoppingList = ["milk", "bread", "eggs"];
shoppingList[1] = "butter"; // Changes the second element from "bread" to "butter"
console.log(shoppingList); // Outputs: ["milk", "butter", "eggs"]
```

**What’s happening here?**

- We changed the value at index 1 (the second slot) from "bread" to "butter".
- All other elements remain the same.
- You can update any element, whether it’s in the first position or the last.

**Real-world analogy:**  
Imagine your favorite playlist. If you want to swap out the second song for a new hit, you just replace it in the list—no need to rewrite the whole playlist!

## Common pitfalls and how to avoid them

Arrays are powerful, but mistakes can sneak in if you aren’t careful. Here are two pitfalls every beginner should watch out for:

### 1. Out-of-bounds access

If you try to access an index that doesn't exist in your array, JavaScript doesn’t crash, but it returns a special value: `undefined`.

```javascript
let pets = ["cat", "dog", "hamster"];
console.log(pets[3]); // Outputs: undefined (there is no index 3 in an array of three)
```

- Valid indexes are from 0 up to (but not including) the array’s `.length`. For example, an array of 3 elements (`pets.length` is 3) has valid indexes 0, 1, and 2.

**How to avoid this?**

- Always check your array's `.length` before accessing elements, especially in loops or user-driven code.
- Remember: The last element's index is always `array.length - 1`.

### 2. Unintended overwriting

If you assign a new value to an existing index, the old value is replaced. This is expected. But if you accidentally assign a value to an index way outside the current array size, JavaScript will expand the array and fill the gaps with `undefined` elements.

```javascript
let friends = ["Anna", "Ben"];
friends[5] = "Charlie"; // Now there are extra undefined elements in the array
console.log(friends); // Outputs: ["Anna", "Ben", undefined, undefined, undefined, "Charlie"]
```

- This makes your array longer, but the new spots in between are empty (`undefined`).
- Double-check your index values before assignment.

**Summary tip:**  
When in doubt, review your array’s length and valid index range! Use comments in your code to remember where and why you access or change a value.

## Activity: Practice accessing and updating array elements

It’s time to get hands-on and reinforce your understanding by working directly with arrays!

### Step-by-step instructions

1. **Open a JavaScript editor** (on your computer, or online at [JSFiddle](https://jsfiddle.net/), [CodePen](https://codepen.io/), or similar).
2. **Create an array named `favoriteFoods`** with at least four food items (e.g., `["pizza", "sushi", "tacos", "salad"]`).
3. **Access and print the first and third items** in your array to the console.
    - Use `console.log()` and square bracket notation.
4. **Modify the second item** (index 1) in your array to a different food.
    - For example, change "sushi" to "burgers".
5. **Print the updated array** to the console to see your change.
6. **Attempt to access an out-of-bounds index** (e.g., index 10) and print the result. Note what appears.
7. **Add comments** to each step in your code explaining what you are doing and why.

### Deliverable

- Copy and paste your full code snippet—including the outputs and comments—into the class chat or virtual whiteboard.
- Include one or two sentences reflecting on what surprised you or what you learned, especially about zero-based indexing or modifying elements.

### Discussion prompt

Arrays are commonly used for lists you need to update—like schedules, shift rosters, or inventory. Think of a situation at your job, in your studies, or at home where being able to quickly update or pull out an item from a list (using its position) could make you more efficient or help prevent mistakes. Share your scenario with the class, and reply thoughtfully to a classmate’s idea: What additional benefit might arrays bring to their situation?

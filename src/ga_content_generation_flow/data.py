<h1>
  <span class="headline">Modularization Documentation</span>
  <span class="subhead">Style Guide - Technical Voice</span>
</h1>

This guide outlines standards for technical writing during the modularization work at GA. It will help you achieve a consistent technical voice. Adhering to these guidelines for all technical modular content ensures a unified content presentation and a seamless transition between lectures for learners.

## Get cozy

Write conversationally. If a sentence sounds formal or distant when read aloud, consider revising it. Aim for a friendly, personable tone. Use contractions. Avoid using Latin abbreviations like e.g., or i.e.

## But not too cozy

Remember, someone else might present your written content. Allow instructors to infuse their style, but avoid jokes that may not resonate with all. Steer clear of idioms, scare quotes, and overly colloquial phrases. They might be misunderstood by native English speakers and can be especially confusing for ESL learners.

## Write inclusively

For guidelines on inclusive writing, refer to the **Inclusivity & Best Practices Guide** in the [General Assembly Brand Guide](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1eldhzkHPyS7T2_NCryMm-IFY1gKsxNYY/view) for general guides on writing inclusively. When writing code, also consult the [Technical Style Guide](./technical-style.md).

## We're in it together

Engage the reader as a fellow traveler. Use inclusive language like **let's, we, and us**.

Be empathetic. Foresee the reader's challenges and address them. Never omit steps. If a visual might explain a concept better, discuss this with your team.

Celebrate achievements! 🎉

## Get to the point

Prioritize essential information. Structure your writing for easy scanning to aid live lectures. Present crucial details prominently, not buried in larger paragraphs. Keep it simple.

Be concise. Eliminate redundant words or sentences. Avoid unnecessary adverbs, particularly those that are subjective, like "quickly" or "easily."

## Precise but brief

Avoid over-explaining a concept. Get the point across, but don't repeat it.

When possible, use words that have one clear meaning. Words that can act as both nouns and verbs can be easily misunderstood and should be used carefully.

Use one term consistently to represent a concept. Sounding repetitive is preferable to introducing confusion by switching between multiple terms for the same thing.

Start new paragraphs more often than you would in formal writing.

## Impress to connect, connect to impress

Strive to deliver accurate and digestible content. While occasional mistakes are inevitable, unnoticed errors in the curriculum quickly erode trust from both students and instructors. Accurate, smoothly delivered content fosters better connections and makes it easier for instructors to do their jobs.

Don't make potentially controversial changes to the curriculum without bringing a group of other voices into the room.

## Express intent

Our written content should stand alone and be comprehensible without the aid of a video or live presentation. Don't rely on another instructor to read into your writing cues and know to expand on an idea.

If a topic is important enough that the content is incomplete without it, always opt to include it.

## Examine your assumptions

Assume that learners are intelligent and capable of learning, but be careful making any further assumptions. Don't assume they are familiar with technical or business jargon - when using these terms, you should define them.

# General Assembly’s Learning Philosophy

## Putting Real Skills to Work

The world is moving the fastest it ever has.

And skills are somehow evolving even faster.

At General Assembly, we understand how difficult it is for individuals and businesses alike to keep up with emerging technologies and the constant evolution of roles. The skills and tools needed to succeed in these roles are constantly changing. It can feel overwhelming for everyone—especially those early in their careers, contemplating new paths, or advancing in nontraditional ways—as well as for businesses inside and outside of the tech space.

Today’s workforce, regardless of industry, is increasingly fueled by tech skills that are becoming even more valuable as the digitally charged future of work, and all things AI, become more commonplace.

We’ve spent the last 13 years working with employers, tech experts, and industry insiders to build a learning ecosystem that helps everyone thrive in a digital-first world. This ecosystem empowers efficient talent, skill, and process transformation and breaks down barriers for underrepresented and historically marginalized groups, particularly in tech.

Over 100,000 students have gained skills and confidence through our programs. We believe that anyone can learn technical and workplace skills with the right experience, support, and community—and everyone should have the opportunity to improve their lives through learning.

**All the best,**

## Our Learning Philosophy at a Glance

Great learning experiences require planning and are grounded in evidence-based design. Our research-backed learning philosophy and guiding principles aim to:

- **Engage** learners by capturing attention, encouraging persistence, and offering flexibility.
- **Support** learners with feedback, community, and collaboration.
- **Prepare** learners for real-world application and independence.

---

## Engage

### Captivate and Encourage
Learning happens best when it focuses on the most essential knowledge, connects to real-life relevance, and keeps learners motivated.

### Focus on the Objectives
Learning should concentrate on core content, activities, and assessments that align with objectives while minimizing distractions and extraneous content.

### Give Learning Content the Spotlight
User experience matters. Learning platforms and materials should be intuitive and focused, enabling easier understanding with purposeful navigation and visuals.

### Keep Learners Going
Motivate learners by making personal connections and showing relevance to their lives and jobs. Use real-world examples, case studies, and relatable stories.

### Promote a Growth Mindset
Learning should reinforce that skills can improve with practice. Learners need to hear and believe that improvement is always possible.

### Be Flexible
Learning must fit into diverse lifestyles, whether learners are students, professionals, caregivers, or all of the above. Design should support remote and blended learning.

### Activate Remote Learning
Remote and blended models often outperform traditional ones. Benefits include:
- More time for practice
- Greater personalization and feedback
- Flexibility in schedule and learning style
- Integrated experiences across formats

---

## Prepare

### Focus on Real-World Application
Learning should emphasize doing, not just knowing. Learners must be equipped to apply skills on the job.

### Incorporate Realistic Practice
Design learning to mimic real-world tasks, with contextual scenarios, practical exercises, and job-aligned challenges.

### Model and Explain a Variety of Scenarios
Expose learners to complex, varied problems and demonstrate how to solve them. Provide reasoning behind each step and explore different solution paths.

### Make Routine Tasks Second Nature
Use repetition and procedural learning to automate routine tasks. Enable learners to internalize processes.

### Support Complex Problem-Solving
For non-routine tasks, provide varied examples and theoretical support. Emphasize critical thinking, reasoning, and adaptability.

### Build Independence
Enable learners to perform independently, make decisions, and reflect on performance.

#### Encourage Self-Regulated Learning
Support planning, goal-setting, monitoring progress, and self-reflection.

#### Allow Choice and Control
Give learners autonomy over pacing, content order, and focus areas to support motivation and self-directed progress.

#### Promote Independent Practice
Encourage learners to solve problems before seeking help. Practice resilience and persistence to build job-readiness.

---

## Support

### Emphasize Feedback
Feedback should be specific, individualized, timely, and actionable. It helps learners understand mistakes, improve performance, and self-monitor.

### Provide Scaffolding Through Coaching
Use coaching and scaffolding to move learners from supported to independent performance. Scaffolding strategies include:
- Simplifying tasks
- Managing processes
- Reducing frustration
- Prompting reflection

### Be Social
Collaboration enhances learning, simulates real work environments, and supports social connection.

#### Enable Collaborative Learning
Encourage peer feedback, conversation, and real-audience work. Social learning fosters engagement and deeper understanding.

#### Use Collaborative Learning Strategically
Social learning works best when foundational skills are already in place. Use it for open-ended tasks, discussions, and complex problem-solving.

---

## Bringing It All Home

At General Assembly, we believe effective learning should always:

- **Engage**: Capture attention, motivate learners, and fit into their lives.
- **Prepare**: Focus on real-world applications and build independence.
- **Support**: Emphasize feedback, coaching, and community.

---

ga_inclusivity_guidelines = """
# GA Inclusivity Guidelines

**GA’s mission is to enable people to pursue the work they love.**  
Implicit in that mission is opening career paths to individuals underserved by broader education and employment systems—especially people of color and women pursuing lucrative tech careers historically dominated by white men.

Media and cultural stereotypes contribute to this imbalance. For example, the persistent image of the upper-middle-class white male as the "typical programmer" affects both who chooses to enter the field and how those who don’t match that image are treated.

**GA can help shift these perceptions by affirming that everyone belongs in tech.**

---

## Inclusivity Checklist

### ✅ Representation Matters. Lead with Diversity.

Pending a GA-wide definition, **diversity** includes:

- Race  
- Ethnic identity and country of origin  
- Gender, gender identity, and sexuality  
- Socioeconomic status and class  
- Ability  
- Age  
- Affinities, interests, and hobbies  

**Our curriculum should be human and relatable. Use:**

- Real quotes from thought leaders  
- Real business examples and case studies  
- Fictional companies and realistic scenarios  
- Analogies  
- Memes, GIFs, and light humor  

**Checklist:**

- Avoid only using white, gendered names like "John Doe" or "Jane Smith"  
- Use a name generator to create diverse character names  
- Ensure visible diversity in videos, photos, and graphics  
- Feature quotes from Black, Brown, and women thought leaders  
- Use case studies from minority- and women-owned businesses  
- Cast actors and interviewees from diverse backgrounds across lessons  

---

### ✅ Avoid Gendered Language and Stereotypes

Gender bias often shows up in subtle ways. We must actively look for and remove it.

**Examples:**

- ❌ “manKind”  
- ✅ “humanKind”

**Checklist:**

- Use gendered terms only when referring to someone who identifies that way  
- Avoid stereotypical associations (e.g., lipstick for “vanity metrics”)  
- Alternate use of “he,” “she,” and “they” when describing characters  

---

### ✅ Avoid Regionally-Specific Analogies and References

We're a global company. American-centric content may alienate non-U.S. learners.

**Examples:**

- ❌ Football team analogies  
- ✅ Restaurant analogy with globally relevant KPIs

**Checklist:**

- Replace analogies specific to one culture or location  
- Avoid defaulting to U.S. cities/landmarks  
- Use globally recognized brands (e.g., Coca-Cola instead of Tab)  
- Use international currencies where appropriate (Euros, Pounds, etc.)  

---

### ✅ Be Careful with Idioms and Turns-of-Phrase

**Examples:**

- ❌ “Scrub your database of dirty data”  
- ✅ “Remove incorrect or corrupt data from your database”

**Checklist:**

- Avoid idioms and slang  
- Define jargon clearly and early  
- Have a subject matter expert (SME) check translations  
- Use simple, direct language in knowledge checks  
- Avoid phrases like “killing it” or “crushed that project”

---

### ✅ Always Have Transcripts or Captions for Videos

Transcripts and captions:

- Help English language learners follow along  
- Are essential for learners with hearing disabilities  
- Improve comprehension for everyone  

---

### ✅ Avoid References to Pork, Beef, Dogs, Alcohol, and Sex

These references may conflict with religious or cultural beliefs. Avoid:

- Pigs / pork products  
- Beef  
- Dogs  
- Alcohol, drugs, partying  
- Sexual or romantic content  

> **Note:** If excluding these items compromises educational quality or values, consult HR.

---

### ✅ Provide Differentiation for In-Person Courses

Learners have different comfort levels with public speaking, creative thinking, and course content.

**Checklist:**

- Mix activity types: individual, pair, group  
- Provide clear instructions and structure  
- Offer templates and examples for presentations  
- Offer frameworks for creative tasks  
- Provide alternative icebreakers based on region  
- Include "basic" and "bonus" requirements for tasks  

---

### ✅ Use Case Studies from Everywhere

Don’t default to U.S.-centric examples.

**Checklist:**

- Use case studies from at least two countries or regions per lesson  
- Include alternative regional examples in speaker notes  
- Choose globally recognized U.S. brands if used

# Exercise Instruction Guidelines

> **Golden Rule:**  
> **"Don't make me think."**  
> When students are confused by the structure or operations of an exercise, they have less mental space to focus on the actual learning. Clear instructions help students learn and help instructors support students effectively.

Use the following guidelines when writing instructions for **solo, pair, or group exercises**.

## Must-Haves

### 1. **State the Purpose of the Exercise**
- Explain **why** students are doing this exercise.
- Clarify the intended **learning outcomes**.
- Connect it to previous or future class content.

### 2. **Clearly Explain the Deliverables**
- Define how students should **demonstrate completion**.
- Examples: take notes, complete a worksheet, share with the class, finish a coding task.

### 3. **Explain Each Student's Role**
- For **pairs or groups**, outline **individual responsibilities**.
- Clarify if different students have different tasks or outputs.

### 4. **Break Down the Steps**
- Use **bullets or numbered lists** instead of paragraph text.
- Ensure the **order of operations** is easy to follow.
- For multi-step activities, consider **one step per slide** for clarity.

### 5. **Use the Right Slide Template**
- Choose the template that best suits the **type and format** of the activity.
- Refer to the guidance deck for template suggestions.

### 6. **Check for Inclusivity**
- Use **clear, jargon-free language**.
- Ensure **visuals and references** are diverse and culturally appropriate.
- Design exercises to be relevant for a **global audience**.
- _[See inclusivity guidelines for more details.]_

### 7. **Adapt for Remote Learning**
- Avoid location-based phrases like:
  - "Turn to a partner"
  - "At your table"
- Keep instructions **location-neutral** on slides.
- Add remote-specific instructions in **instructor notes**.
- _[See remote classroom guidelines for more details.]_

## As Needed

### 1. **Share an Example of the Final Output**
- Provide a **sample deliverable** when possible.
- Helps students understand what a "good" result looks like.

### 2. **Assign a Group Speaker**
- If groups will present, remind them to **choose a speaker** to share out.

<h1>
  <span class="headline">Modularization Documentation</span>
  <span class="subhead">Style Guide - Markdown Document Structure</span>
</h1>

This document provides a collection of standards for document structure and formatting to ensure a consistent and coherent representation of our product. We can achieve uniformity across all our written assets by adhering to these guidelines.

Find what you need quickly using the links below to jump to what you need in this doc.

## Contents

- Headings
  - Casing
- Lists
- Callouts
- General Markdown Guidelines
  - Relative Paths
  - Placeholder text
  - Spacing
- Formatting inline text
  - Variables or short lines of code
  - Properties or methods
  - Directories, file names, and file paths
  - URLs and URIs
  - Keyboard shortcuts
  - UI Interactions
  - Terms and definitions
  - Adding emphasis

## Headings

All documents should start with a [hero banner](../component-library/heroes.md). There will never be another hero banner or h1 heading in a document ever.

`h2`-`h4` headings are written in sentence case (see the [Casing](#casing) section below).

`h2` headings (`##` in markdown) break up the big ideas of the document.

`h3` headings (`###` in markdown) break big ideas into smaller sections when necessary.

`h4` headings (`####` in markdown) are discouraged and often signal poor document structure. `h5` and `h6` headers are not allowed.

Headings should never directly follow one another. This indicates a poor document structure or a lack of breadcrumbing. Add some written copy or an asset between them.

Microlesson content shouldn't have a table of contents. Consider adding one in other documents only if necessary.

Do not skip heading levels. For example, an `h4` shouldn't follow an `h2`.

### Casing

Use sentence style casing (capitalize the first letter of a sentence and any proper nouns) for almost all copy, excluding the `h1` of a document, which should use title casing in AP Style.

You should use a tool like [Capitalize My Title](https://capitalizemytitle.com/style/ap) to format titles in AP Style because the details are frankly silly.

---

## Lists

Lists should contain two or more items. Lists should actually be lists, not content that would otherwise be paragraphs formatted as lists. In general, list items with four or fewer words do not need ending punctuation, but if any list item requires ending punctuation, all list items should have ending punctuation.

List items should start with a `-` character, and an empty line in markdown should exist before and after a list. For example:

This is my list of lists:

- My list
- Your list
- Our list

The above example is created with this markdown:

```markdown
This is my list of lists:

- My list
- Your list
- Our list

```

---

## Callouts

Callouts should be placed inside of the blockquote element `>`.

Use Callouts sparingly to maximize impact. These emojis should be used at the start of a callout for consistency:

🤯 - Something mind-blowing.

🧠 - Denotes content that wrinkles your brain. Use this to flag another way to do something or a more advanced way of writing a preceding code block.

💡 - A light bulb moment! Use this to make connections you want to make an impact with.

🏆 - Indicates a best practice

⚠ - A topic you want to urge caution about. Pay attention when you're doing this, or something may go wrong.

🚨 - A topic that requires complete and urgent attention. Use sparingly. Pay attention to this, or something will absolutely go wrong

❓ - A stand-alone single review question.

♻️ - Denotes information that can be used to construct a mental model around - either steps that can be repeated or patterns that are commonly used.

📚 - Defines a term used in the previous block. The term should be *italicized* in that block and *italicized* in the definition.

😎 - Play it cool. Use this to provide context around a piece of complicated code or keep the calm during a complex process.

Here is an example:

> 🏆 Callouts should begin with an emoji!

And another:

> 😎 You don't need to memorize these; this documentation is always here.
>
> The more you write, the less you'll need to reference this document.

And another:

> 💡 Speaking of that, have you bookmarked this page yet?

The above examples are created with this markdown:

```markdown
Here is an example:

> 🏆 Callouts should begin with an emoji!

And another:

> 😎 You don't need to memorize these; this documentation is always here.
>
> The more you write, the less you'll need to reference this document.

And another:

> 💡 Speaking of that, have you bookmarked this page yet?
```

---

## General Markdown guidelines

### Relative paths

When navigating within a project, use the full relative path. For example, if linking to a file in an assets directory, opt for `./assets/file.png` instead of `assets/file.png`, as shown here:

```markdown
![MongoDB Atlas walkthrough](./assets/ui-interaction-text.png)
```

This helps ensure content doesn't break if it is ever ported off of GitHub.

---

### Placeholder text

Use the text **tktk** ([common in publishing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/To_come_(publishing))) and a short note as a placeholder for forthcoming work. All documents should be searched for this placeholder before they are published.

---

### Spacing

Add a line of whitespace between each markdown element.

Do not use double spaces after punctuation.

---

## Formatting inline text

The following rules apply to formatting inline text.

### Variables or short lines of code

Place the variable name or short line of code in an *inline code block*. For example:

Create an array named `movies` containing the titles of three of your favorite movies as strings.

The above example is created with this markdown:

```markdown
Create an array named `movies` containing the titles of three of your favorite movies as strings.
```

---

### Properties or methods

How you refer to properties or methods in copy will change depending on the context, but they'll always be wrapped in an *inline code block*. When required for clarity, you should include the object a property or method belongs to. For example:

The color of the car is stored on `car.color`. Start the car with the `car.start()` method.

The above example is created with this markdown:

```markdown
The color of the car is stored on `car.color`. Start the car with the `car.start()` method.
```

Sometimes, adding the object will be unnecessary or even confusing, like when talking about a generic property or method on a data type. In this case, leave it off. For example:

Access the last element in an array with the classic `length` property.

Or use one of the more recent additions to JavaScript - the `at()` method.

The above example is created with this markdown:

```markdown
Access the last element in an array with the classic `length` property

Or use one of the more recent additions to JavaScript - the `at()` method.
```

Note that there is no `.` before the method name, but it is followed by `()`. We also directly call it a method in the copy. This provides enough context to determine that it is a method.

---

### Directories, file names, and file paths

Directories, file names, and file paths in copy should be wrapped in an *inline file path component*. For example:

Open your Terminal application and navigate to your <code class="filepath">~/code/sei/lectures</code> directory.

Make a new directory called <code class="filepath">js-arrays</code>, then enter this directory.

Then, create an <code class="filepath">app.js</code> and an <code class="filepath">index.html</code> file.

The above example is created with this markdown/HTML:

```markdown
Open your Terminal application and navigate to your <code class="filepath">~/code/sei/lectures</code> directory.

Make a new directory called <code class="filepath">js-arrays</code>, then enter this directory.

Then, create an <code class="filepath">app.js</code> and an <code class="filepath">index.html</code> file.
```

See the [inline file paths](../component-library/inline-text-components.md#inline-file-paths) documentation for more details on using the *inline file path component*.

---

### URLs and URIs

URLs and URIs should both be wrapped in `inline code blocks`. URLs should also include a link to that location. For example:

Navigate to <`http://localhost:3000`>

You can use Google by going to <`https://google.com`>

In your app, create a `/movies` route.

The above example is created with this markdown:

```markdown
Navigate to <`http://localhost:3000`> 

(NOTE: You could also use [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) 
above to achieve the same result. Both are valid in the style guide/markdown)

You can use Google by going to <`https://google.com`>

(NOTE: You could also use [https://google.com](https://google.com) above
to achieve the same result. Both are valid in the style guide/markdown)

In your app, create a `/movies` route.
```

You typically shouldn't use a URL in copy; use an aliased link where possible. Only write out a full URL as shown above if it makes sense in the context of your work.

---

### Keyboard shortcuts

Keyboard shortcuts should be wrapped in an *inline keyboard keys component*. Keyboard letters should be capitalized. When keyboard shortcuts are provided, they must be supplied for all of the operating systems we expect in cohorts. For example:

- Use <kbd>Command</kbd> + <kbd>Shift</kbd> + <kbd>4</kbd> to take a screenshot on macOS.
- In Windows, use <kbd>Windows</kbd> + <kbd>Shift</kbd> + <kbd>S</kbd>.
- In Ubuntu, use <kbd>Shift</kbd> + <kbd>Print</kbd>.

The above example is created with this markdown:

```markdown
- Use <kbd>Command</kbd> + <kbd>Shift</kbd> + <kbd>4</kbd> to take a screenshot on macOS.
- In Windows, use <kbd>Windows</kbd> + <kbd>Shift</kbd> + <kbd>S</kbd>.
- In Ubuntu, use <kbd>Shift</kbd> + <kbd>Print</kbd>.
```

See the [inline keyboard keys](../component-library/inline-text-components.md#inline-keyboard-keys) documentation for more details on using the *inline keyboard keys component*.

---

### UI Interactions

When giving directions for interacting with UI elements, use *bold text* to indicate the content of that element.

Using the following screenshot as an example, here's a matching caption:

![MongoDB Atlas walkthrough steps](./assets/ui-interaction-buttons.png)

In the sidebar, click the **Database** option under the **DEPLOYMENT** header.

Then click the **Browse Collections** button.

The above example is created with this markdown:

```markdown
In the sidebar, click the **Database** option under the **DEPLOYMENT** header. 

Then click the **Browse Collections** button.
```

When instructing students to type text - for example, to fill out a form - use *inline code blocks*.

Using the following screenshot as an example, here's a matching caption putting these two ideas together:

![MongoDB Atlas walkthrough](./assets/ui-interaction-text.png)

Enter `0.0.0.0/0` in the **IP Address** field and `Anywhere` in the **Description** field.

Then click the **Add Entry** button.

The above example is created with this markdown:

```markdown
Enter `0.0.0.0/0` in the **IP Address** field and `Anywhere` in the **Description** field.

Then click the **Add Entry** button.
```

---

### Terms and definitions

New terms that will be defined in a callout (see the [Callouts section](#callouts)) should be identified inline with *italicized text*. The word should also be *italicized* in the accompanying callout. For example:

Arrays can contain zero or more items called *elements*.

> 📚 An *element* is an individual item stored at a specific position within an array.

The above example is created with this markdown:

```markdown
Arrays can contain zero or more items called *elements*.

> 📚 An *element* is an individual item stored at a specific position within an array.
```

---

### Adding emphasis

When you'd like to add emphasis, use *bold and italicized text*. This should be done sparingly. For example:

If you click the red button, bad things will happen. ***Do not click the red button.***

The above example is created with this markdown:

```markdown
If you click the red button, bad things will happen. ***Do not click the red button.***
```

> Formatting note: Wrap bold text in `**`; for example, `**this text should be bold**`. Wrap italicized text in `*`; for example, `*this text should be italicized*`. Wrap bold and italicized text in `***`; for example, `***this text should be bold and italicized***`.

<h1>
  <span class="headline">Modularization Documentation</span>
  <span class="subhead">Style Guide - Modular Code</span>
</h1>

This document provides a collection of standards specifically around code and other technical content to help build a more consistent and internally coherent modular product. These guidelines should be followed for all technical modular content.

Find what you need quickly using the links below to jump to what you need in this doc.

## Contents

- Data in code
  - Inclusion
  - Clarity
- Code blocks
  - Providing context in comments
- Code details
  - Quotes
  - Line length
  - Variable names
  - Semicolons
  - Bash/Shell code
- GitHub
- Directory structure
- Assets in student work
- File names
- JavaScript Specific Code Style
  - Declaration
  - Spacing

## Data in code

You must make specific considerations when creating data to be used in code.

### Inclusion

When crafting examples in code for core content, aim to satisfy these requirements in order of importance:

- Brevity
- Diversity
- Popularity
- Recency

For example, if you were crafting an array of movies, you should aim for popular movies and franchises with short names released in the last ten years. The array as a whole should display a diverse set of characters, stories, and genres. The names must be short to ensure that the point of the lesson isn’t lost by having students be overly concerned with typing long words.

Don’t forget the overriding characteristic: brevity. While **Everything Everywhere All at Once** satisfies the need to be diverse, popular, and recent, some students may fall behind while writing it out. Those needs do not override the requirement to set students up for academic success.

> 🎉 The goal is for every student in a classroom to be engaged with the theme of our content and not feel excluded by curriculum choices.

These are good goals to aim for in a live setting but do not override the priority of being genuine and creating connections in your classroom.

---

### Clarity

When modeling data, avoid potentially confusing property names. For example:

```javascript
const todos = [
  {todo: 'Feed Dogs', done: true},
  {todo: 'Learn Express', done: false},
  {todo: 'Buy Milk', done: false}
];
```

When this data is iterated over, it will likely result in `todo.todo` being used, which could be awkward and confusing for students (and this also isn’t a descriptive property name). Opt for data that looks something like this option instead:

```javascript
const todos = [
  {text: 'Feed Dogs', done: true},
  {text: 'Learn Express', done: false},
  {text: 'Buy Milk', done: false}
];
```

---

## Code blocks

Code blocks must be language labeled; see the [highlight.js docs](https://highlightjs.readthedocs.io/en/latest/supported-languages.html) for a list of valid languages.

Do not use anything in code blocks that is not valid code. For example, to demonstrate that more code belongs between two pieces of code in the same file, use a comment:

```javascript

import Movie from '../models/movie.js'

// more code is here!

// Do not do something like the following:
.
.
.
// Do not do the above!

function edit(req, res) {
  // edit function code
}
```

Breaking the one code block into two is even more ideal than the above.

### Code block file paths

**Purpose**: File paths should be placed above a code block to indicate the file that the code belongs in. For example:

`my/file/path`

```javascript
console.log("Wow, so cool! I love file paths 🥰")
```

To do this write this code:

```markdown
`my/file/path`

```javascript
console.log("Wow, so cool! I love file paths 🥰")
```

This uses native markdown and relies on a post-processor for styling. Just wrap the file path inside of an inline code block (`` ` ``) on its own line (nothing else can be on this line!) immediately before any code block.

### Providing context in comments

Ensure code snippets provide context to help learners understand the operations being performed.

When applicable, show the expected output or call out the data held in a variable after a line of code is executed. Avoid using symbols or anything that could be confused as code for this - prefer written language instead. For example:

```javascript
const movies = ['Barbie', 'Interstellar', 'Get Out'];

const firstMovie = movies[0];
// firstMovie is 'Barbie'
```

When something is logged to the console use the phrase `Prints: whatever is printed`. For example:

```javascript
function printBanner(text) {
  console.log('========================');
  console.log(text);
  console.log('========================');
}

printBanner('We can make this banner say anything!');

// Prints:
// ========================
// We can make this banner say anything!
// ========================
```

## Code details

### Quotes

Prefer `'` in code instead of `"`, except when `"` is preferred by the language - for example, with HTML or Java.

---

### Line length

Lines of code in code blocks should never be longer than 80 characters.

---

### Variable names

Do not use single letter variable names ever. Beyond this, prefer more descriptive variable names without being excessively verbose.

Use camelCase or PascalCase when appropriate in JavaScript. Use snake_case or SCREAMING_SNAKE_CASE when appropriate in Python.

Avoid shorthand that isn't ubiquitous - for example, using `err` instead of `error` is acceptable.

---

### Semicolons

End lines with semicolons in languages that will allow it.

---

### Bash/Shell code

Bash and shell code should not include leading indicators such as `$` or `#` to ease copying content.

---

## GitHub

GitHub repository names should be kebab-cased.

---

## Directory structure

All students in tech verticals are expected to maintain a standard directory structure as described below:

Students will all have a `code` directory inside of their user root directory with a `ga` directory inside of it.

Inside of `~/code/ga`, students will have these directories:

- `labs` - For all lab assignments. Students/instructors may decide to further divide lecture content into weeks, units, or topics covered, but this is ultimately up to those parties.
- `lectures` - For all class lectures. Students/instructors may decide to further divide lecture content into weeks, units, or topics covered, but this is ultimately up to those parties.
- `projects` - For any large projects done in a course.
- `sandbox` - For quick experimentation.

> This may be different outside of the tech vertical. Check with your onboarding point of contact.

---

## Assets in student work

All multimedia assets in student projects should be organized in an `assets` directory.

---

## File names

Ensure all file names use kebab-case for consistency and ease of reference.

## JavaScript Specific Code Style

### Declaration

Variables in JavaScript should not be declared with `var`.

---

### Spacing

Always use a 2-space indentation in your code.

</h1>

This document provides a collection of standards for writing modular content to ensure the tenants of modularization are adhered to. By adhering to these guidelines, we can achieve uniformity across all our modular content.

## Global content

The following guidelines pertain to writing tone and voice and are important not only to maintain a consistent feel between lectures but also ensure our curriculum can be consumed by a global audience.

### Latin abbreviations

Avoid Latin abbreviations like e.g. or i.e. Use English language equivalents instead.

---

### Serial (Oxford) commas

Use the Oxford comma to ensure clarity. For example:

> We went caroling with our dogs, grandma, and grandpa. ***Not:*** We went caroling with our dogs, grandma and grandpa

---

### Ampersands

Avoid ampersands in copy, use *and* instead.

---

### Ellipses

Avoid ellipses in copy.

---

### Language quirks

Steer clear of idioms, scare quotes, and overly colloquial phrases. They might be misunderstood by native English speakers and can be especially confusing for ESL learners.

Avoid idioms. Even though they are an easy avenue to make writing more playful and fun, they can be hard to understand for some learners.

Avoid words that have multiple meanings and could be easily misunderstood - especially words that can be used as both nouns and verbs.

---

### Active vs. passive voice

The active voice is a direct way of building sentences, where the subject performs the action. This contrasts with the passive voice, where the subject is acted upon. Here are the key differences between the two:

**Active Voice**
Structure: Subject + Verb + Object
Example: "The team completed the project."
Benefits: Enhances clarity, fosters engagement.

**Passive Voice**
Structure: Object + Form of "Be" + Past Participle + (by + Subject)
Example: "The project was completed."
Usage: Suitable when the action is more important than the doer or when the doer is unknown.

> ⚠️ Americans that speak English as a first language are particularly prone to writing in a passive voice (says the American writing this). You may not even realize you write passively until you're made aware of it. You can substantially improve your writing and also make it more globally accessible by writing in an active voice.

---

## Timeless modular content

The following guidelines pertain to writing tone and voice and are important not only to maintain a consistent feel between lectures but also ensure our curriculum is long-lived. You should refer to the [Technical Voice](./technical-voice.md) document for most purposes, but some specifics are detailed below.

### AI assistants

Refer to any AI assistant (chatGPT, bard, Copilot, etc.) using the umbrella term *AI assistant*, unless you are referring to a specific model for a specific reason.

---

### Timeframes

Do not mention any timeframes in content. For example, do not use *this afternoon*, *yesterday*, *tomorrow*, *last week*, etc.

---

### Referencing content

Do not mention any content outside of the current microlesson. Do not mention current, past, or future units. Do not mention labs, even those with a natural association with the module. Do not reference other microlessons within a module, even if it is the same one.

---

## Link between modules and microlessons

Do not link to content held in other modules, as this defeats the purpose of modularization. The only exception to this is content in the `universal-resources` module.
